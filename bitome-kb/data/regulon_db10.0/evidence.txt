GID000000001	Author statement	all objects	AS	Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author<br>statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support<br>for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of<br>its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.<br>		ECK12	W  	Author statement	GID000000001	
GID000000002	Traceable author statement	all objects	TAS	Traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or <br>in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the<br>assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,<br>but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported<br>the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS <br>is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the<br>assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was<br>not done to support the assertion.<br>In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,<br>but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.

GID000000020	Gene expression analysis	regulatory interaction|transcription factor|promoter	GEA	The expression of the gene is analyzed through a transcriptional fusion (i.e. lacZ), and  a difference in expression levels is observed when the regulatory protein is present  (wild type) vs in its absence.  Note that this evidence does not eliminate the possiblity of an indirect effect of the regulator on the regulated gene.		ECK12	W  	Classical experiment	GID000000036	RI: Transcriptional fusions (lacZ). | TF:  Transcriptional fusions
GID000000021	Inferred through co-regulation	transcription unit	ITCR	Inferred through co-regulation.  A transcription unit is inferred because a set of <br>adjacent genes that are transcribed in the same direction exhibit similar<br>expression patterns under a range of environmental conditions.<br>		ECK12	W  	Classical experiment	GID000000036	TU: 2+ adjacent genes show the same expression pattern across conditions.

GID000000030	Binding of purified proteins	regulatory interaction|transcription factor|promoter	BPP	There exists physical evidence of the binding of a ligand to its target site (for instance binding of a TF to its TFBS).

GID000000032	Traceable author statement to experimental support	all objects	TASES	Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or <br>in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the<br>assertion.  However, the statement did reference another publication describing an experiment <br>that supports the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS <br>is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the<br>assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was<br>not done to support the assertion.<br>In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,<br>but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.		ECK12	W  	Author statement	GID000000014	PM: A review article refers to a promoter citing a reference as the source for the experimental evidence.

GID000000033	Inferred from physical interaction	promoter|regulatory interaction|transcription factor	IPI	IPI inferred from physical interaction<br><br>The assertion was inferred from a physical interaction such as<br><ul><br>    <li> 2-hybrid interactions<br>    <li> Co-purification<br>    <li> Co-immunoprecipitation<br>    <li> Ion/protein binding experiments<br></ul><p><br>This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of<br>interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such<br>as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is<br>simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay<br>directly detects the binding. For both IPI and IGI, it would be good<br>practice to qualify them with the gene/protein/ion. <br>		ECK12	W  	Classical experiment	GID000000014	TF:Two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, co-purification
GID000000034	Inferred from mutant phenotype	promoter|regulatory interaction|transcription factor | enzymatic-reaction|protein|transcription unit	IMP	IMP inferred from mutant phenotype.<br><br>The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as<br><ul><br>    <li> Any gene mutation/knockout<br>    <li> Overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant genes<br>    <li> Anti-sense experiments<br>    <li> RNA interference experiments<br>    <li> Specific protein inhibitors<br>    <li> Complementation<br></ul><p>    <br>Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or<br>abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP<br>(compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies <br>or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no<br>gene may be mutated (the rationale is that EV-IMP is used where an<br>abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).<br>		ECK12	W  	Classical experiment	GID000000014	PM: Deletion of promoter regions. |  RI: A mutation of a transcription factor has a visible cell phenotype, and it is inferred that the regulator might be regulating the genes responsible for the phenotype. | TF: Any gene mutation/knockout, overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type genes or genes carrying mutations in the effector binding domain of the transcription factor.
GID000000035	Inferred from genetic interaction	regulatory interaction| promoter|transcription factor	IGI	IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br><br>The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as<br><ul><br>    <li> \ Traditional\  genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.<br>    <li> Functional complementation<br>    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene<br></ul><p><br>This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence<br>(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This<br>category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done<br>in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when<br>all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all<br>be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, <br>this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI<br>than IMP annotations.)<p><br>IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative<br>because it is similar to that of another independent		ECK12	W  	Classical experiment	GID000000014	RI:In vitro titration assay.
