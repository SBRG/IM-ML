Based on the study mentioned above, Mihara et al. (2008) postulated that an unknown factor, depending on the Fe-S cluster, controls either directly or indirectly the expression of these genes |CITS:[18482579]|. <br>The <i>iscS</i> gene plays an important role in the expression of pyrimidine metabolism genes and provides proof of the potential relationship between <i>iscS</i> and global gene regulation |CITS:[18482579]|.<br>Under either anaerobic or aerobic growth conditions, IscR represses transcription of the operon <i>iscRSUA</i>, which encodes genes for the Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathways. The repression of the <i>isc</i> operon by IscR responds to the demand for the Fe-S cluster in the medium, because IscR has to be bound to an Fe-S group to be able to repress the transcription of the <i>isc</i> operon |CITS:[23075318]|. Under anaerobiosis, the demand for the Fe-S group is lower than under aerobiosis, and therefore the repression of the operon is stronger than under aerobiosis |CITS:[23075318]|.<br>IscR recognizes and binds two DNA-binding sites that overlap the promoter sequence to repress transcription of the <i>iscRSUA</i> operon. Therefore, it appears that when the protein is bound to these sites, the RNA polymerase is not able to bind to the promoter region to start transcription |CITS:[23075318]|. Although the two sites are required for complete repression of the operon, the binding of IclR to one of them does not depend on the presence of the other |CITS:[23075318]|.<br>IscR regulates in a coordinated manner the expression of the <i>iscRSUA</i> to the <i>sufABCDSE</i> operons through repression by  [2Fe-2S]-IscR and activation by apo-IscR, respectively.

ECK120009051	ECK120010045	bglGFB	ECK120015098	ECK12	The <i>bglGFB</i> operon codes for one of four &beta;-glucoside utilization systems in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [12081976]|.  It codes for the autoregulatory antiterminator BglG, the EII glucoside transporter BglF, and the glucosidase BglB |CITS: [3034860]|.  This operon is silent in wild-type cells grown in the lab due to the transcriptional regulator HNS |CITS: [1452042]|, but it can be activated by insertion of an IS element upstream of the operon, as well as by point mutations within the CRP-binding site or within <i>gyrA</i> or <i>gyrB</i> |CITS: [1311089][6270569][3025456]|. <br>Once the operon is released from its silent state, it can be activated by Crp and repressed by Fis |CITS: [10792463][10760165]|.  The <i>bgl</i> promoter is controlled by &sigma;<sup>S</sup>, whose effect is mediated by Crl |CITS: [12081976][12177351]|.  Once silencing ceases, <i>bglGFB</i> expression is controlled by the aromatic &beta;-glucosides salicin and arbutin via an mRNA antitermination mechanism |CITS: [2846278]|.  BglG is activated by phosphorylation by HPr (or FPr) but is inactivated by additional phosphorylation by BglF at a different site |CITS: [10369677]|.  BglG is both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by BglF, the enzyme II component of the Bgl sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system.  The phosphorylation state of BglG at the BglF site is controlled by one of the &beta;-glucoside inducers.  In the absence of &beta;-glucoside, BglG associates with and is phosphorylated by BglF in the cytoplasmic membrane.  Addition of the inducer leads to dephosphorylation of BglG at the BglF site, and its localization to the cytoplasm where it forms homodimers and its transcriptional antitermination activity allows transcription of the <i>bgl</i> operon.  The doubly phosphorylated form of BglG is unable to dimerize and bind to the target mRNA and does not have antiterminator activity |CITS: [1382312][2195546][2200123][2673534][12771379][15769463]|. <br>In the absence of the activated BglG homodimer, transcription from the <i>bgl</i> promoter is terminated at one of two rho-independent terminators.  The first is located in the leader region of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA at a site immediately upstream of the <i>bglG</i> translation start site, and the second lies between <i>bglG</i> and <i>bglF</i> |CITS: [3034860][3301003][2846278]|.  BglG is able to bind to a site in the <i>bgl</i> mRNA which partially overlaps the rho-independent terminators, possibly blocking the formation of the terminator secondary structure and allowing transcription |CITS: [1698125]|.  BlgG binding stabilizes the 5' end of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA |CITS: [11426055]|.  BglG also binds the &beta;-subunit of RNA polymerase |CITS: [10200263]|. <br>In addition to these well-established forms of transcriptional regulation, the <i>bgl</i> operon expression is also affected by StpA, Hfq, LeO, and BglJ, but their specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS: [9473058][7984093][9422614][8725214]|. <br>Repression of the <i>bglGFB</i> operon by StpA occurs only in the presence of the N-terminal H-NS protein domain, which comprises the core for dimerization |CITS: [18245262]|.

ECK120009194	ECK120010987	aceBAK	ECK120015031	ECK12	The genes of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon are expressed  to varying degrees due to two facts:  first, they are differentially regulated at the translational level and second, there is a putative premature transcriptional termination in the region preceding the <i>aceK</i> gene |CITS:[16415587]|. For review see |CITS:[16415587]|. <br>IclR represses <i>aceBAK</i> transcription through two mechanisms |CITS:[12492863]|: (1) binding to the proximal site, overlapping the -35 promoter box and preventing the RNA polymerase binding; (2) binding to the distal site after the RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter and formed the open complex, avoiding the polymerase escape of the promoter through its interaction with the &alpha;-subunits. Perhaps the IclR binding at both sites forms a intermolecular bridge that leads to a DNA loop structure and thus enhances the <i>aceBAK</i> repression |CITS:[12492863]|. <br>While glyoxylate favors the inactive dimeric state of IclR, pyruvate increases the binding of IclR to the aceBp promoter by stabilizing the active tetrameric form of the protein |CITS: [17426033]|.<br>Under conditions of glucose excess, the protein IclR is a stronger repressor of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon than is the ArcA protein |CITS:[ 21481254]|.<br>Under nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of the <i>aceA</i> gene was increased in mutants for two genes that encode two terminal oxidases, <i>cyoA</i> and <i>cydB</i>, but  under nitrogen-limited growth conditions, the gene expression was decreased in a <i>cyoA</i> mutant.  However, under both nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of <i>aceA</i> is increased in mutants for Fnr and Fur. It is unknown if the effects of the transcriptional regulators act directly on the gene expression |CITS:[21272324]|.<br>The functional conformation of IclR has been proposed to be a dimer |CITS:[1447784]| or tetramer |CITS:[11420439]|. In 1996, Pan et al. proposed that IclR binds to a binding site of 15 bp (TGGAAATtATTTCCA) in the intergenic region of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon |CITS: [8682810]|. Footprinting experiments showed that IclR binds, as a dimer and monomer, to two regions upstream of the transcription start site of <i>aceB</i> |CITS: [12492863]|. Pan et al. identified one specific site, of 7 bp, for IclR at the distal site, effectively characterized by footprinting at bp -122 relative to the transcription start site of <i>aceBAK</i> |CITS:[12492863]|. According to this evidence, the curator assigned five possible binding sites of 7 bp for <i>iclR</i>, located at -26, -53, -104,  -131, and  -141, which are included in the regions protected in footprinting experiments.

Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.

For full repression, the protein binds to three TyrR boxes |CITS:[3041242]|. Two of them, located at positions -29.5 and -52.5 bp from the transcriptional start site (TSS), are adjacent to each other and overlap the promoter; the third is located further upstream of the promoter (-104.5 bp from the TSS) |CITS:[3294794],[3001025]|. All three boxes are aligned on the same face of the DNA helix, and it was proposed that they form a repression loop |CITS:[3041242]|.	
ECK120009202	ECK120010993	aroG	ECK120014830	ECK12	The <i>aroG</i> gene has been shown to be repressed by TyrR in the presence of phenylalanine and tryptophan <i>in vivo</i>,  while tyrosine reverses this repression |CITS: [2861143] [4884590]|. However, according to Baseggio et al., the three aromatic amino acids did not show any effect in a footprinting analysis using purified TyrR, although they suggested that the footprinting analysis perhaps lacked a cellular component necessary for the interaction of the aromatic amino acids with TyrR |CITS: [1970563]|. In contrast with the regulatory region of other members of the TyrR regulon that have two or three TyrR boxes, the regulatory region of the <i>aroG</i> gene has a single TyrR box |CITS:[1970563]|.

TrpR acts differently at each operator and binds to multiple helically stacked sites |CITS:[3315853]|.	
ECK120009204	ECK120010995	aroL-yaiA-aroM	ECK120014832	ECK12	The expression of the <i>aroL-yiaA-aroM</i> operon seems to be repressed by the interaction of two proteins, TyrR and TrpR, because the effect of TrpR cannot be seen in the absence of TyrR and the effect of TyrR is enhanced in the presence of TrpR. This suggests that a putative physical interaction between TyrR and TrpR or a conformational change in the DNA caused by TyrR facilitates the binding of TrpR. Moreover, TrpR can stabilize TyrR binding |CITS:[7961453]|.<br> In the presence of tyrosine plus ATP, tryptophan, and to a lesser extent phenylalanine, the TyrR protein binds to three TyrR boxes located at positions bp -45, +12, and +31 from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the aroLp promoter. The -45 and +31 sites are essential to the repression, and the TyrR dimers bound to them seem to interact through the formation of the DNA loop structure that would sequester the RNA polymerase-binding region |CITS:[7961453]|. The +12 site, which is a weak TyrR box, may not be essential for repression |CITS:[7961453]|. <br>A putative IHF site was identified around the +31 TyrR box. This site seems to have a negative effect on the repression mediated by tyrosine |CITS:[7961453]|.	
ECK120009205	ECK120010996	aroP	ECK120014477	ECK12	The transcription from the aroPp1 promoter is repressed by the TyrR<br>protein by recruiting the RNA polymerase to a nonproductive promoter<br>located divergently from the aroPp1 promoter overlapping it.

While<br>this repression can be observed in the presence of tyrosine, a lesser<br>repression is seen in the presence of phenylalanine or tryptophan |CITS:[<br>9765583] [3025182]|.<br>TyrR binds to a strong and a weak TyrR box located at 40.5 and 63.5 bp <br>downstream of the aroPp1 promoter, respectively. The strong TyrR box is<br>directly involved in the repression of the aroPp1 promoter, although the<br>participation of the weak box has not been discarded |CITS:[9765583]|.

On the other hand, in 1997, Pedersen and Valentin-Hanses showed that CytR binds to octamer repeats, GTTGCATT in either the direct or inverted orientation and preferably separated by 2 or 3 bp |CITS: [9155036][9466254]|. For this reason the length of the CytR DNA-binding site is variable.<br>However, footprinting analyses showed that the dimers of CytR are flanked or sandwiched by two dimers of CRP |CITS:[12667072][11574471][845188][8394345][1655726][1649947][8221894]|. Thus, the binding sites of CytR located in this region were assigned by the curator in agreement based on similarity to the consensus sequence and on the data from the footprinting assays and mutational evidence |CITS:[8969182][1327747][20000490][9155036][2170326][12391883]|.<br>The repressor CytR and the activator CRP, two dimeric proteins, interact to form a complex repressor nucleoprotein in the intergenic region. When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS: [8394345][1649947][8736525][10766824][ 8221894]|. The CytR protein cannot act alone; the synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct interaction with CRP |CITS:[ 8394345][1655726][1649947][ 8221894][1962841][2170326][1649947]|.

ECK120009226	ECK120010128	ilvY	ECK120014847	ECK12	DNase I footprint analysis |CITS: [3062177][9556617]| and DNA binding assay results |CITS: [3062177]| showed that IlvY binds in tandem upstream of the transcription start site of the gene <i>ilvY</i>. Wey et al. proposed that this regulator binds to regions of 28 bp that contain inverted repeat motifs of 21 bp |CITS: [3062177]|. Using a new methodology based on analysis of orthologous sequences, the curator has identified the consensus sequence of IlvY (aTTGCaAatattGCAAT) of 17 bp, which is similar to the consensus sequence identified in the RegPrecise database (aTTGCaaaatttGCAAt).	
ECK120009227	ECK120011002	katG	ECK120014848	ECK12	|CITS:[12589799]| demonstrated that both <i>oxyR</i> and <i>katG</i> gene expression, which codify a transcriptional regulator and a product essential for the detoxification against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress, respectively, were absolutely dependent on polyamines during entry into the stationary phase. These data suggest that polyamines could be directly participating in the defense mechanism against oxidative stress. Both putrecine and spermidine polyamines increase expression of of the <i>oxyR</i> and </i>katG</i> genes, which are responsible for defense against oxidative stress |CITS: [12948384]|.<br>The transcription of the gene <i>katG</i> is enhanced under high oxygen saturation (300%) in the absence of the superoxide dismutase proteins SodA and SodB |CITS:[ 23497217]|.	
ECK120009228	ECK120010129	kdpFABC	ECK120029377	ECK12	The <i>kdpABC</i> operon should now be referred to as <i>kdpFABC</i> |CITS: [10608856]|.	
ECK120009229	ECK120010130	lacZYA	ECK120014850	ECK12	The <i>lac</i> operon is controlled by four promoters, P1, which is the principal promoter, P2, and P3 and P4, the weaker promoters |CITS:[1649816][1650341]|. Transcription of this operon is both negatively and positively regulated. Negative regulation occurs when the <i>lac</i> repressor (LacI) binds to the operator, preventing transcription by RNA polymerase |CITS:[6259624][2166165]|. Positive regulation is mediated by the cAMP receptor protein, CRP (also referred to as the catabolite activator protein, CAP)  |CITS:[1649816][1650341][15385551]|. <br>In the presence of glucose, <i>lac</i> operon expression is not needed and a control mechanism known as catabolite repression occurs. This refers to the ability of glucose to inhibit expression of the operon. As cellular cAMP levels drop in response to glucose uptake, CRP is not activated and operon expression is inhibited. Under this mechanism, <i>lac</i> genes are only expressed if lactose is present and glucose is absent.  <br>In the absence of glucose, the levels of cAMP increase and this metabolite binds to CRP. CRP becomes active and it binds to DNA near the <i>lac</i> promoter, facilitating transcription |CITS:[6259624][2166165]|.  Synthesis of the <i>lac</i> operon proteins is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown on lactose in the absence of glucose. CRP is the principal activator of the <i>lac</i> operon. It stimulates transcription of p2, increasing the affinity for the RNA polymerase |CITS:[2166165][1650341]|. The p2 is a class II promoter, and CRP activates transcription of class II CRP-dependent promoters by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoter; the central position of the binding site is located near -41.5 |CITS:[17073754][8735277][8604346]|. In the same way, CRP completely overlaps p1 and p3, avoiding RNA polymerase binding and preventing transcription of these promoters |CITS:[2166165][1650341]|. <br>On the other hand, in the absence of allolactose, the LacI repressor represses the <i>lac</i> operon |CITS:[2166165][15950160]|. In this repression system, LacI binds to two operators centered at positions 10 bp (O1) and -82 bp (O3), and formation of the repressor loop is critical |CITS:[8984648][ 8984647][14725772][2166165]|. Expression of p1 is also stimulated when LacI binds to O1 |CITS:[2166165]|. <br>Induction occurs when the physiological inducer, allolactose, binds to the <i>lac</i> repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator |CITS:[2166165][15950160]|. Nonphysiological analogs, such as thiogalactosides, can function as inducers too. Activation of the <i>lac</i> operon can also be partially increased by CRP when it overlaps the O1 site, acting as an antirepressor |CITS:[3315229][2166165]|.<br>In single-cell experiments, total induction of the <i>lac</i> operon produces a constant distribution in the production of mRNA molecules in all growth phases, except in the exponential phase, where two mRNA populations are present |CITS:[25626902]|.<br>Considering the activation site of the <i>lac</i> operon like the upstream activation region of the promoter sequence (URS) and the operator region like downstream derepression region of the promoter sequence (DRS), the independent URS activation produces a small number of mRNA molecules compared to DRS activation. This behavior corresponds to early stages of cell growth and later stages, respectively. However, it is probable that in the exponential phase URS and DRS work coordinately in the transcription of the <i>lac</i> operon |CITS:[ 25626902]|.<br>A mutation in the HU protein that generates positive superhelicity causes repression of the <i>lac</i> operon |CITS:[ 21896677]|.

ECK120009232	ECK120010134	malPQ	ECK120014853	ECK12	Through DNase footprinting analyses, Danot and Raibaud (1994) showed that CRP binds at the promoter region of <i>malPQ</i>, centered at -93.5 upstream of the transcription start site of malPp |CITS:[7830577]|. However, the destruction of the CRP site has no effect on the transcription of the operon <i>malPQ</i>. In this way, the effect of CRP on the expression of <i>malPQ</i> might be indirect and mediated by MalT as a direct regulator |CITS:[7830577] [6120934] [7040340]|.	
ECK120009233	ECK120010135	melR	ECK120012348	ECK12	MelR binds to five target sites, sites R (+2.5), 1' (-116.5), 1 (-136.5), 2 (-174.5), and 2' (-194.5), in the <i>melR</i> promoter, where the less-conserved site 2' (7 of 18 bases) binds MelR most weakly  |CITS [10760178]|. MelR binding to site 2' (-194.5) occurs only in the presence of melibiose |CITS [12060687]|. <br>Based on <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> methods, a repression model was proposed in which four DNA-bound MelR molecules are required for optimal autorepression of the <i>melR</i> operon [site 2 (-174.5), site 1 (-136.5), site 1' (-116.5, and site R (+2.5)] in the absence of melibiose. This means that MelR autoregulates its own expression by binding to site +2.5 and repressing its own promoter. This repression is reinforced by upstream binding of MelR |CITS: [18346968]|. Elrobh et al. (2013) showed that efficient repression of the <i>melR</i> promoter by MelR requires an interaction between the proximal R (+2.5) and distal 2 (-174.5) sites and results in loop formation, as seen with another AraC member (AraC controlling the <i>araC-araBAD</i> intergenic regulatory region) |CITS:[23066992]|.<br>In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate the <i>melAB</i> promoter but autoregulates its own expression by repressing the <i>melR</i> promoter |CITS [10760179]|. Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of the <i>melAB</i> promoter and relieves MelR-dependent repression of the <i>melR</i> promoter |CITS[12060687], [10760179], [10747919], [1445208], [10760178]|.

Both transcriptional regulators repress transcription initiation by interfering with RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[18757534]|. <br>Fis represses transcription in the absence of IHF I and IHF II, and this repression is less efficient when one or both of the DNA sites for IHF are inactivated |CITS:[18757534]|.<br>	
ECK120009240	ECK120010138	nrdAB-yfaE	ECK125135284	ECK12	Based on ChIP-chip and consensus sequences (Virtual Footprint), a site of NsrR negatively controlling the <i>nrdB</i> gene has been identified |CITS:[19656291]|. The consensus sequence found for this gene is AAAATGCCTTAT, which lies in the intergenic region <i>nrdA</i>-<i>nrdB</i>.<br>DnaA acts both as an activator and a repressor on the <i>nrdAB-yfaE</i> operon, depending on the changing concentration of DnaA-ATP during the cell cycle |CITS:[20487274]|. DnaA-ATP binds cooperatively to two high-affinity sites upstream of -35 (-48 and -36.5) and to a lower-affinity site overlapping the <i>nrdAB</i> promoter region (-14) |CITS:[20487274]|.<br>Based on the DNase I protection pattern, it was shown that DnaA-ADP binds to the sites upstream of -35 (-48 and -36.5) with lower affinity than DnaA-ATP, although at high DnaA-ADP/DnaA-ATP ratios |CITS:[20487274]|.<br>It has been shown that <i>nrdA</i> is not regulated <i>in vivo</i> by ArgP |CITS:[21890697]|. However, ArgP slightly binds to the regulatory regions of <i>nrdA</i> <i>in vitro</i>, as it exhibits low-affinity binding to ArgP |CITS:[21890697]|.<br>Gel shift assay |CITS: [9819053][21890697]| and DNase I protection assay results |CITS: [9819053]| showed that ArgP binds in tandem upstream of the transcription start site of the gene <i>nrd</i>. Despite strong experimental evidence, those authors did not identify the center positions of the binding sites. The curator identified the consensus sequence of ArgP and assigned the possible central position of these binding sites, based on similarity to consensus sequences. According to this evidence, the curator assigned six possible binding sites of 20 bp for ArgP, located at bp -163.5, -190.5,  -218.5, -244.5, -281.5, and -334.5 relative to the transcription start site of <i>nrd</i>. Based on DNase I protection assay results |CITS: [9819053]|, the curator suggested that ArgP binds with higher affinity to the binding sites located at a -244.5, -218.5, and -190.5.<br>H-NS represses expression of the class Ia (<i>nrdAB</i> operon) and class III (<i>nrdDG</i> operon) ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) both in aerobically and in anaerobically growing cells. Under aerobic conditions, repression occurs during the exponential phase of growth as well as at the transition from the exponential to the stationary phase, a period when no dNTPs are needed. Under anoxic conditions, repression occurs mainly in exponentially growing cells |CITS:[23873909]|.<br>A second region under control of H-NS was identified 127 bp downstream of the <i>nrdA</i> transcriptional start site within the <i>nrdA</i> structural gene.

ECK120009256	ECK120010141	rhaSR	ECK120014876	ECK12	This is an unusual transcription unit that codes for two genes encoding two transcriptional regulators, RhaS and RhaR, both members of the AraC family of regulators. It is interesting that the <i>rhaSR</i> transcription unit is located close to a divergently transcribed transcription unit encoding the <i>rhaBAD</i> genes. This organization is similar to that of the divergent <i>araC-araBAD</i> genes. <br>RhaR is a transcriptional regulator that positively regulates the <i>rhaSR</i> operon. Its effect has been experimentally demonstrated to be enhanced by CRP. <i> In vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that the centered position of CRP at -111.5 relative to the rhaSp is required for the majority of the CRP-dependent activation of the rhaSR operon. <i>In vitro</i> transcription assays indicated that the &alpha;-CTD of the RNA polymerase is both partially dispensable for RhaR activation and required for CRP activation of the <i>rhaSR</i> operon |CITS: [16166533]|. <br>Besides the RhaS and RhaR regulators, there are four sites for a CRP transcriptional regulator that are localized at the <i>rhaSR-rhaBAD</i> intergenic region. It seems that all of the proteins that control the <i>rhaSR</i> operon are on the same face of the DNA and on the opposite face of the DNA relative to the proteins that control the <i>rhaBAD</i> operon |CITS: [16166533]|.<br>Wickstrum et al. (2009) proposed a model for RhaS negative autoregulation where RhaS competes with RhaR for binding at the <i>rhaSR</i> promoter. In addition, this model proposes that differential DNA bending by RhaS and RhaR may be the basis for the differences in CRP coactivation. At relatively low RhaS concentrations, RhaR and CRP both contribute to <i>rhaSR</i> activation; at that time, expression is at its maximum level and CRP contacts the &alpha;-C-terminal domain (CTD). On the other hand, at relatively high RhaS concentrations, RhaS binds to the RhaR-binding site, thus replacing RhaR. RhaS activates the <i>rhaSR</i> operon but CRP is not effectively coactivated, and in this way, <i>rhaSR</i> expression is reduced by three- to fourfold. Here, CRP does not contact the &alpha;-CTD |CITS:[19854903]|. This mechanism is unusual in that a transcriptional activator functions to decrease expression of an operon by activating transcription |CITS:[19854903]|.

ECK120009260	ECK120010144	trpLEDCBA	ECK120014577	ECK12	The <i>trpLEDCBA</i> (trp) operon codes for the enzymes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. It is subject to several layers of regulation, including regulation of transcriptional initiation and ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. <br>The expression of the <i>trp</i> operon is repressed 300-fold by TrpR. TrpR binds at the trpLp promoter, possibly directly blocking binding by RNA polymerase |CITS: [3050131]|. The genes within the <i>trp</i> operon also appear to be targeted for repression during anaerobiosis by the global regulator FNR, although it is still unknown which trp promoter (trpCp or trpLp) is affected and whether the effect is direct or indirect |CITS: [12754220]|. <br>WrbA initially appeared to influence the interaction betweenTrpR and the trp operator |CITS: [8516330]|. However, other research indicates that this is a nonspecific effect, with both WrbA and BSA generating an equivalent gel shift result |CITS: [9694845]|. <br>The Trp attenuator regulates transcription through the trp operon in response to the abundance of charged tRNA-Trp in the cell. When charged tRNA-Trp is abundant, mRNA transcription terminates within the leader sequence of the operon. Alternately, when charged tRNA-Trp is not abundant, transcription continues through the length of the operon |CITS: [4578102][4872441][4586412][340702][781269][781270][781271]|. The physical mechanism of transcriptional attenuation involves the close coupling of transcription and translation. In the case of the trp attenuator, the ribosome begins translating the leader peptide, TrpL, as RNA polymerase continues to transcribe the rest of the <i>trp</i> operon |CITS: [781274]|. This leader peptide contains a key pair of tryptophan codons. When charged tRNA-Trp is scarce, the ribosome stalls at these codons and RNA polymerase proceeds with transcription. Alternately, when charged tRNA-Trp is abundant, the ribosome quickly reads through these codons and RNA transcription terminates in the leader sequence |CITS: [6159477][366606]|. <br>Trp attenuation and the required close linking of translation and transcription all depend on the formation of alternate RNA secondary structures. When the ribosome proceeds quickly through the <i>trpL</i> leader sequence, a hairpin forms in the mRNA that acts as a transcriptional terminator. When the ribosome stalls due to lack of charged tRNA-Trp, an alternate RNA hairpin forms that prevents formation of the transcriptional terminator, allowing transcription of the RNA to continue |CITS: [781274][6159477][366606][118451][368800]|. The close coupling of transcription and translation is achieved through yet another RNA secondary structure. The <i>trpL</i> leader region has a third alternative hairpin that forms in the absence of the ribosome. This prevents formation of the antiterminator, in turn allowing the terminator to form and stall RNA polymerase. Thus, transcription cannot proceed unless the ribosome is present and charged tRNA-Trp is scarce |CITS: [2409288][6168281][2991886]|.<br>The <i>trpLEDCBA</i>, <i>aroH</i>, and <i>trpR</i> operons are coordinately regulated by the TrpR transcriptional repressor in response to intracellular levels of L-tryptophan (|CITS: [3315853]| and references therein). TrpR acts differently at each operator and binds to multiple helically stacked sites |CITS: [3315853]|.

ECK120009278	ECK120010157	tnaCAB	ECK120014894	ECK12	The <i>tnaCAB</i> operon codes for two key enzymes in tryptophan metabolism, including tryptophanase. It is regulated by attenuation within its leader region in response to tryptophan abundance. When tryptophan is present, transcription continues through a Rho-dependent terminator and <i>tnaA</i> and <i>tnaB</i> are transcribed |CITS: [3902796]|. In addition, <i>tnaCAB</i> is also subject to regulation at the level of transcriptional initiation via CRP, although this is not the main regulatory control on the operon |CITS: [3902796]|. <br>Attenuation of <i>tnaCAB</i> occurs via ribosomal pausing at the tail end of the <i>tnaC</i> leader sequence. As translation of the leader peptide nears completion, it halts with the terminal proline of TnaC still attached to its tRNA and stuck within the ribosome. In the absence of tryptophan, peptide chain release factor RF1 and peptide chain release factor RF2 cleave TnaC from the tRNA and free the ribosome. This, in turn, allows access by Rho to a Rho-dependent terminator that then prematurely terminates transcription of <i>tnaCAB</i>. In the presence of tryptophan, release by RF1 and RF2 is prevented, and the ribosome remains in place, blocking access by Rho to the terminator and allowing continued transcription of the operon |CITS: [3902796][8682777][10869076][11050101][11470925][11880383]|. Eventually, the stalled ribosome is cleared away by ribosome recycling factor and peptide chain release factor RF3 |CITS: [17293419]|. As a natural consequence of this mechanism, attenuation at <i>tnaCAB</i> depends on both translation of the leader peptide and the presence of Rho |CITS: [7543478][8522534][2345136]|. <br>This close coupling of transcription and translation is achieved via an RNA polymerase-pausing mechanism. There is a pause site toward the latter end of the <i>tnaC</i> sequence. The RNA polymerase pauses there, allowing time for the ribosome to attach to the nascent RNA and begin translation. When the ribosome reaches the paused RNA polymerase, transcription continues. This pausing mechanism ensures that the ribosome is in the proper position to regulate the Rho-dependent terminator in response to tryptophan abundance |CITS: [14563884]|.<br>Rho-dependent termination within the <i>tnaC</i> sequence depends on both a <i>rut</i>- and a <i>boxA</i>-like sequence within the leader region of the operon |CITS: [10869076]|. The role of the <i>boxA</i>-like sequence in promoting termination is peculiar, as the actual <i>boxA</i> sequence normally acts as an antiterminator |CITS: [11880383]|.<br>Stalling of the ribosome during translation of TnaC depends on a complex interaction between the leader peptide and the ribosome. Attenuation is completely dependent on the sole tryptophan within the leader peptide sequence. Mutations at this position make tryptophan induction of <i>tnaCAB</i> impossible |CITS: [2345136]|. Specific residues within TnaC, most notably Asp-16 and Pro-24, are essential for inhibiting clearing of the TnaC-tRNA complex from the peptidyl transferase center within the ribosome and for altering the conformation of the 23S RNA in a manner that may help generate a tryptophan-binding site on the ribosome |CITS: [18424524]|.<br>Both YdgT and HolE appear to influence expression of <i>tnaA</i> by enhancing transcription termination at the leader DNA sequence |CITS: [24375106]|.<br>Based on work with mutant strains, it was determined that FNR, NarL, and NarP negatively regulate the <i>tnaCAB</i> operon in the exponential growth phase during anaerobic respiration of nitrate |CITS:[27631134]|.

The negative effects of HU and IHF seem to be relieved by the positive effect of TyrR |CITS:[8892849]|. <br>In the presence of tyrosine and ATP, the TyrR protein is bound to two tyrR boxes, a strong one and a weak one, located at -76.5 and -106.5 bp upstream of the mtrp promoter, respectively. At these positions, the <i>mtr</i> gene expression is fully activated by TyrR |CITS:[1938967]|. <br>In the presence of phenylalanine or in the absence of an effector, the TyrR protein bound to the strong TryR box partially activates the transcription. When the TrpR protein is absent, tryptophan can also activate the transcription of <i>mtr</i> |CITS:[1938967]|. <br>During the transcription activation of <i>mtr</i>, there may be an interaction between the  TyrR protein and the &alpha;-CTD of the RNA polymerase. The residues leucine-262, arginine-265, and lysine-298 are mainly involved in this interaction. When TyrR is absent, the &alpha;-CTD seems to interact with the UP element centered at -41 from the transcriptional start site of the mtrp promoter to activate the transcription |CITS:[9324270]|. <br>TrpR plus tryptophan can repress the expression of <i>mtr</i>; however, when the TrpR protein is absent, tryptophan can also activate the transcription |CITS:[1938967]|. <br>When tryptophan is present, the TrpR protein binds to two sites overlapping the mtrp2 promoter. Therefore, TrpR could block the binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter. With high tryptophan levels, the repression is dominant over the activation; with low tryptophan levels, activation and repression can interact to regulate the <i>mtr</i> gene expression |CITS:[2061290]|.

ECK120009337	ECK120010206	cysDNC	ECK120014943	ECK12	Originally, there were two operons, <i>cysNC</i> and <i>cysD</i> described. In the MedLine paper |CITS: [ 2828368 ]|, it was demonstrated that <i>cysN</i> and <i>cysC</i> were both contained in one operon.   The evidence was the strong polarity  between <i>cysN</i> and <i>cysC</i>, although no promoter was described.  It was not determined whether  the upstream gene (<i>cysD</i>) was part of the same operon, but the authors suggested that all the genes could be transcribed because their products are part of the same metabolic pathway.   In a more recent paper, MedLine reference |CITS: [2185135]|, a promoter upstream of <i>cysD</i> was described. In a third  reference |CITS: [1316900]| it is proposed that the three genes are translationally coupled, confirming that they reside within the same operon.

Under anaerobic conditions, FNR activates binding at the -41.5 site, but its activation is repressed by IHF at the -55 site. When nitrate or nitrite is present, NarL is activated (via NarX or NarQ) and, upon binding to its target site, IHF is displaced and derepresses the FNR site to allow its dependent activation. Fis binding plays a central role in the catabolite repression of the <i>nrf</i> operon.

ECK120009540	ECK120010380	rpsU-dnaG-rpoD	ECK120014515	ECK12	The unusual <i>rpsU</i>-<i>dnaG</i>-<i>rpoD</i> operon, conserved in different gram-negative bacteria, participates in macromolecular synthesis |CITS:[8316085]|. The <i>rpsU</i> gene encodes the S21 protein, which is a component of the 30S subunit of the ribosome, the <i>dnaG</i> gene encodes a DNA primase that catalyzes the synthesis of RNA primers on single-stranded template DNA, and the <i>rpoD</i> gene encodes the primary &sigma; factor that plays the most important role in promoter regulation during exponential growth (&sigma;<sup>70</sup>). As it can be seen, this operon comprises three essential genes, whose products represent each of the three different main cellular molecules (RNA, DNA, and protein). In this way, this operon comprises three existing information fluxes of the central dogma of molecular biology, and its products participate in indispensable functions: in the initiation of protein synthesis (S21) and RNA synthesis from different templates (DNA primase, single strand; &sigma;<sup>70</sup>, double strand) |CITS:[8316085] [6186393]|. <br>The coordinated expression of this operon is dependent on three tandem promoters, P1, P2, and P3, which are activated under different conditions |CITS:[6206376] [2848013]|. However, the expression of individual <i>rpsU</i> and <i>rpoD</i> genes can be independently regulated by their own promoters. About the end of the operon, there are two terminators, an internal terminator (T1) in the intergenic region between the <i>rpsU</i> gene and <i>dnaG</i> gene and a rho-independent terminator at the end of the operon (T2). The internal terminator might respond to antitermination by the lambda phage N gene product.

ECK120009666	ECK120010447	pyrLBI	ECK120016916	ECK12	The <i>pyrLBI</i> operon is regulated primarily by attenuation in response to pyrimidine availability. <br>The <i>pyrLBI</i> operon is controlled by an attenuator that responds to the abundance of UTP by a polymerase-pausing mechanism. <i>pyrL</i>, the gene coding for the PyrL leader peptide, contains a transcriptional terminator preceded by a poly(T) sequence. When UTP levels are low, transcriptional pausing occurs at this poly(T) sequence |CITS: [6300835]|. More generally, this sequence leads to UTP-responsive transcriptional control, as transcription terminates there when UTP is abundant and proceeds when UTP levels are low, in a manner that depends on the presence of the terminator |CITS: [2991885]|. The poly(T) tract is also absolutely required for transcriptional termination |CITS: [2656651]|. <br>The proposed model for the <i>pyrLBI</i> attenuator is that of polymerase pausing, in which the RNA polymerase may pause at the poly(T) sequence when UTP is lacking, giving the following ribosome a chance to catch up. The proximity of the ribosome then prevents formation of the terminator and premature termination of transcription. In contrast, when UTP is abundant the polymerase races ahead of the ribosome, allowing the terminator hairpin to form and terminating transcription. Partial confirmation of this model comes from the fact that in strains with mutated, slow-moving ribosomes, <i>pyrLBI</i> transcription is far more effectively inhibited by UTP |CITS: [3044790]|.

The operon contains one internal promoter (Psuc). <br><i>sdhCDAB</i>, <i>sucAB</i>, and <i>sucCD</i> form a cluster containing two promoters. Transcription of the <i>sucABCD</i> genes is primarily initiated and regulated at the upstream <i>sdh</i> promoter. <br>Direct evidence for cotranscription of the entire <i>sdhCDAB-sucABCD</i> region from Psdh was obtained by detecting a 10-kb transcript in <i>rnc</i> and <i>rse</i> mutants. <i>sdh</i> and <i>suc</i> genes belong to a single operon. <br>The absence of a CRP-binding site in the <i>suc</i> promoter region was used to support the early suggestion that the <i>sdh</i> and <i>suc</i> genes are cotranscribed.<br>Under nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of the <i>sdhC</i> gene increased in mutants for two genes that encode two terminal oxidases, <i>cyoA</i> and <i>cydB</i>, and in mutants for two transcriptional regulators, Fnr and Fur. However, under nitrogen-limited growth conditions, gene expression was decreased |CITS:[21272324]|.<br>The expression of this operon is enhanced during and after the switch from aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions |CITS:[ 21980479]|.<br>The expression of the gene <i>sdhC</i> is decreased under acidic growth conditions in either aerobiosis or microaerobiosis |CITS:[23274360]|.<br>Based on DNA microarray analysis, the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by carvacrol and citral was studied |CITS: [28644990]|. Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.

They also identified, by computational methods, PdhR as the regulator of the <i>lldP</i>p1 |CITS: [8892825]|. Recently, based on experimental evidence, Aguilera et al.

ECK120009721	ECK120010667	fimAICDFGH	ECK120020905	ECK12	The expression of genes for type 1 fimbriae (<i>fimAICDFGH</i>) is subject to a mode of regulatory control known as phase variation |CITS:[8878036]|.  In phase variation, individual cells switch between a state of expression (fimbriate) and nonexpression (afimbriate) and thereby produce a population of mixed cell types.  Phase variation of type 1 fimbriae in <i>Escherichia coli</i> is influenced by the orientation of the <i>fim</i> switch, <i>fimS</i>, a 314-bp invertible DNA element |CITS:[2863818]|.  Recombination of the <i>fim</i> switch requires the <i>fimB</i> and <i>fimE</i> gene products, considered to be the <i>fim</i> recombinases |CITS:[8878036]|.  Mutation deletion analyses of <i>fimB</i> and <i>fimE</i> mutants indicates that <i>fimB</i> is able to mediate recombination in both directions (on-to-off and off-to-on) while <i>fimE</i> only stimulates recombination in the on-to-off direction |CITS:[8101185]|.  Inversions of the <i>fim</i> switch at normal frequencies also requires the expression of <i>himA</i> and <i>himD</i>, which are the genes for the two subunits of integration host factor (IHF) |CITS:[2886490]|, <i>lrp</i>, the leucine-responsive regulatory protein |CITS:[7916011]|, and <i>hns</i>, the histone-like protein H1 |CITS:[1648076]|. Lrp recognizes and binds to three DNA-binding sites located within the fim switch, with central positions 204 (site 1), 235 (site 2), and 173 (site 3) bp from the transcriptional start site of the <i>fim</i> operon. The binding of Lrp to site 1 and site 2 favors the inversion process of the invertible region with a bias toward the &quot;on&quot; orientation, but when Lrp binds to site 3, the inversion is inhibited |CITS:[9515701]|. When leucine binds to Lrp, a dissociation of Lrp from site 3 is observed; thus, the inversion of the invertible DNA element is promoted by leucine |CITS:[9515701]|. In addition to the role that Lrp plays in the inversion process, it also seems to be required to keep the inversion trapped in the state of expression |CITS: [16855224]|.<br>By means of gene expression and mutation analysis, it was determined that the LrhA protein regulator regulates positively <i>fimE</i> expression, leading to the repression of the <i>fimA</i> operon through the on-off switch at <i>fimA</i> |CITS:  [16207912]|.

ECK120010883	ECK120009881	argP	ECK120011203	ECK12	In 1999 Celis proposed that ArgP binds to a region of 15 bp (GTCATAGTGCAGGAA) in the intergenic region of <i>argP</i> |CITS: [10600368]|. In contrast, the curator identified two contiguous conserved regions, an inverted repeat of 20 bp which may be the target sequence of ArgP, located at -36.5 (TATATGCAACCTGACACAAA) and -16.5 (ATTGTGTCATAGTGCAGGAA). The sequence proposed by Celis is included in the binding site located at -16.5. The curator identified the consensus sequence of ArgP and assigned the possible central position of these binding sites, based on similarity to consensus sequences.<br>ArgP has been identified as binding as a dimer of dimers in the intergenic region of <i>dnaA</i> in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [9254708]| and also in the regulatory region of <i>gdhA</i> of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> |CITS: [18424527]|. For this reason, there is a possibility that this regulator transcriptionally regulates itself as a dimer of dimers.

Transcriptional fusion experiments demonstrated a positive effect of Fur and a negative effect of HNS on <i>sodB</i> transcription |CITS:[11782507], [2180912],[ 15659676]|, and gel shift assays have shown a weak interaction between Fur and the regulatory region of <i>sodB</i> |CITS:[11782507][ 2180912]|. However, an <i>in vitro</i> transcription analysis demonstrated that Fur has no direct effect on the transcription of <i>sodB</i> |CITS:[11782507]|. It should be noted that Fur regulates in a negative way RhyB, a small RNA that negatively regulates the expression of <i>sodB</i> |CITS:[ 11917098]|.

(2009). They investigated the interconnections and dynamics between Bae, Cpx, Psp, Rcs, and &sigma;<sup>E</sup> pathways and showed that these pathways can be activated simultaneously in response to exogenous or endogenous stimulation, while natural environmental stimuli provoke bacterial modifications that lead to multiple pathway responses |CITS:[19763168]|. <br>Each of these responses might be specialized to ensure a specific aspect of envelope biogenesis and maintenance; on the other hand, CpxR could have a role as a modulator of the response by integrating other endogenous signals.

It is, together with the <i>ilvIH</i> and <i>leuABCD</i> operons, regulated via the promoter-relay mechanism. It was demonstrated by primer extension experiments that <i>ilvIH</i> promoter activity is required for activation of the <i>leuO</i> gene via this mechanism. The AT-rich DNA regions flanking <i>leuO</i> are named locus control regions LCR-I and LCR-II, respectively.

Crl has two overlapping promoters: a housekeeping, Rpo-D &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter and a promoter that is strongly upregulated under nitrogen limitation, RpoN (&sigma;<sup>54</sup>). Both promoters produce similarly sized mRNAS, but only the RpoD-dependent promoter has an <i>rbs</i> gene and can be translated; in turn, it prevents transcription from the RpoD promoter |CITS:[24474781]|.<br>This elegant and economical mechanism, which allows a near-instantaneous reduction in Crl synthesis without the need for transacting regulatory factors, restrains the activity of RpoS to allow faster growth under nitrogen-limiting conditions |CITS:[24474781]|.

ECK120026712	ECK120034426	lipA	ECK120029093	ECK12	PdhR was identified by Kaleta et al. (2010) as a negative regulator of <i>lipA</i>, based on consensus sequences, microarrays, and electromobility shift analyses (EMSA) at bp 69 (designated by Feng and Cronan [2014] as <i>lipA</i> site 1) of the <i>lipA</i>p promoter |CITS:[20718955]|. However, Feng and Cronan (2014) reported that this site is nonfunctional and physiologically irrelevant. The binding detected by Kaleta et al. (2010) is due to another site (<i>lipA</i> site 3) that is located far upstream of the <i>lipA</i>p promoter and which is a half-palindrome with weak PdhR-binding ability |CITS:[24816490]|.<br>Other possible PdhR-binding degenerate palindromes were identified by Feng and Cronan (2014). One of them is downstream of the <i>lipA</i>p promoter at positions 22 to 38 (<i>lipA</i> site 2) and the other one is at positions -293 to -277 (<i>lipA</i> site 3). All three of these sites were present in the EMSA probe used by Kaleta et al. (2010) and thus could contribute to the weak binding observed |CITS:[24816490]|. On the other hand, deletion of <i>pdhR</i> did not cause any detectable change in the <i>lipA</i> transcription level for &beta;-galactosidase activity, indicating that PdhR plays no role in regulation of <i>lipA</i> expression |CITS:[24816490]|.<br>It was concluded that <i>lipA</i> is not controlled by PdhR, based on <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> evidence |CITS:[24816490]|.

ECK120027142	ECK125095453	ftnA	ECK120028807	ECK12	Fur antagonizes the H-NS effect in the <i>ftnA</i> promoter. Fur reverses H-NS-mediated repression of <i>ftnA</i>; displacement of H-NS from sites II (-130.5), III (-83), and IV (-56) prevents cooperative binding at sites V (-21) and VI (+16) and leads to derepression |CITS:[20015147]|. H-NS represses the <i>ftnA</i> operon through six AT-rich binding sites that oligomerize and cause DNA looping |CITS:[20015147]|. The displacement of the upstream sites of H-NS by Fur prevents cooperative H-NS binding at the downstream sites on the transcriptional start site of the <i>ftnA</i> promoter, which allows access to RNA polymerase |CITS:[20015147]|. This manner of activation by Fe<sup>2+</sup>-Fur through H-NS antisilencing represents a new mechanism for iron-induced gene expression. In addition,  <i>ftnA</i> is the first example of a gene with a defined alternative Fe<sup>2+</sup>-Fur induction pathway in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[20015147]|.

Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.

Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively.

Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.

SdsN represses genes involved in the metabolism of oxidized nitrogen compounds. In addition, <i>sdsN</i> confers resistance to nitrofurans through repression of <i>nfsA</i> |CITS:[27166377]|.<br>Several transcripts were detected in the <i>tcyN</i>-<i>sdiA</i> intergenic region during stationary phase. The two most prominent bands were approximately 180 nt (SdsN<sub>178</sub>) and 140 nt long (SdsN<sub>137</sub>) and shared the same Rho-independent terminator. Another band was identified and shown to be a processed transcript of approximately 120 nt (SdsN<sub>124</sub>) |CITS:[27166377]|.<br>The Hfq chaperone binds to SdsN<sub>178</sub>, SdsN<sub>137</sub>, and SdsN<sub>124</sub> with different affinities |CITS:[27166377]|. <br><b>SdsN<sub>178</sub></b><br>SdsN<sub>178</sub> overproduction affected one mRNA, <i>casA</i>, which showed a 2-fold increase and only partial of <i>nfsA</i>,<i>hmpA<i>, and <i>narP</i>. The 5¿¿-end sequence of SdsN<sub>178</sub> is extremely AU rich |CITS:[27166377]|.<br><b>SdsN<sub>137</sub> </b><br>SdsN<sub>137</sub> is transcribed from a sigma&;<sup>S</sup>-dependent promoter. Overexpression regulates negatively four mRNAs related to the metabolism of and response to nitrogen compounds: <i>nfsA</i>, <i>hmpA</i>, <i>ybjC</i>, and the response regulator <i>narP</i>. Other transcripts are regulated by SdsN<sub>137</sub> and do not fall into a single category: <i>cya</i>, <i>uraA</i>, <i>inaA</i>, and <i>rluA</i> are downregulated and <i>fliC</i> and <i>ymfT</i> are upregulated. <i>nfsA</i>, <i>hmpA</i>, and <i>narP</i> were identified as base pairs directly regulated by SdsN<sub>137</sub> |CITS:[27166377]|.<br>The SdsN<sub>137</sub> transcript could be also a processed transcript, since it is within the <i>sdsN</i> gene. There, a Rho-independent terminator with the absolute cordinates 1997022 to 1997057 falls within the <i>sdsN</i> gene.<br><b>SdsN<sub>124</sub> </b><br>SdsN<sub>124</sub> is a processed form from SdsN<sub>178</sub>  and SdsN<sub>137</sub> transcripts and accumulates maximally after 20 h of growth in M63 glucose medium. SdsN<sub>124</sub> represses <i>nfsA</i> and <i>hmpA</i> |CITS:[27166377]|.
