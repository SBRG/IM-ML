ECK120011186	Fis	15	inverted-repeat	EBP		ECK12	Fis, "<b>f</b>actor for <b>i</b>nversion <b>s</b>timulation", is a small DNA-binding and bending protein whose main role appears to be the organization and maintenance of nucleoid structure through direct DNA binding and by modulating gyrase <a title="18340041, 11812843" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cho BK,2008. Schneider R,2001</a>and topoisomerase I production <a title="17233826" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Weinstein-Fischer D,2007</a> as well as regulation of other proteins that modulate the nucleoid structure, such as CRP, HNS, and HU. Fis directly modulates several cellular processes, such as transcription, chromosomal replication, DNA inversion, phage integration/excision, and DNA transposition <a title="1484481, 11278071" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Finkel SE,1992. Travers A,2001</a>  As a transcriptional regulator, Fis regulates the expression of many genes involved in translation (rRNA and tRNA genes), virulence, biofilm formation, energy metabolism, stress response, central intermediary metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, transport, cell structure, carbon compound metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis <a title="17768236, 1484481, 11555281" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bradley MD,2007. Finkel SE,1992. Sheikh J,2001</a> A transcriptome analysis has shown that transcription of approximately 21% of genes is modulated directly or indirectly by Fis <a title="18340041" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cho BK,2008</a>    Fis, together with proteins such as HNS, HU, IHF, and Dps, is one of the largest components of the nucleoid. A ChIP-chip analysis has shown that Fis binds to 894 DNA regions in the genome, which results in two sites of Fis per supercoiling domain. These regions include both intergenic regions and regions within genes, and not all genes to which Fis binds are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to Fis in maintenance of nucleoid structure <a title="18340041" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cho BK,2008</a>  Under optimal growth conditions, Fis is the dominant DNA-binding protein in the cell. Up to 60 000 copies of the protein can be found in a single cell under log phase, but it is nearly imperceptible in stationary phase (<100 molecules per cell) <a title="10515926" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">10515926</a> Fis bends the DNA between 40 and 90&deg; <a title="1484481" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Finkel SE,1992</a> This bending stabilizes the DNA looping to regulate transcription and to promote DNA compaction <a title="17045294, 9642081" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">17045294. 9642081</a>   The crystal structure of Fis has been solved by several research groups <a title="11183780, 1946369, 1986310, 9362499" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Cheng YS,2000. Yuan HS,1991. 1986310. Safo MK,1997</a> and they have shown that this protein has an &alpha;-helical core of four helices (A to D). The C-terminal domain contains the C and D helices, forming a helix-turn-helix motif, characteristic of many DNA-binding proteins. The N-terminal domain has the A helix and a flexible &beta;-hairpin arm, which are involved in DNA inversion; this region appears to make contact with the DNA invertase Hin in the invertasome structure <a title="9362499, 1484481" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Safo MK,1997. Finkel SE,1992</a>  As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, expression of <i>fis</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, Fis is autoregulated, induced by high supercoiling levels <a title="11029698" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11029698</a>, and regulated by both growth rate-dependent and stringent control systems that require the presence of a GC motif downstream of the -10 region <a title="1547773" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ninnemann O,1992</a>.  The growth and the net final biomass produced in a <i>fis</i> single deletion mutant strain growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions were affected relative to responses of the wild-type strain (<i>Escherichia coli</i> strain BW 25113) grown in the same conditions <a title="28573283" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28573283</a>  Transcription of <i>fis</i> is also regulated by the availability of the nucleotide triphosphate CTP, which is the nucleotide with which transcription of <i>fis</i> is initiated and whose largest concentration is seen during log phase, a fact that correlates with the pattern of <i>fis</i> expression. If transcription of this gene is initiated with an A or a G instead of a C, transcription is induced at the same level in early stationary phase rather than in log phase <a title="15385561" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">15385561</a>   A promoter that does not transcribe any ORF is located upstream of the promoter that transcribes <i>fis</i> and in the opposite direction. Under RNA polymerase limitation, both promoters compete for the protein. This might be a type of <i>fis</i> regulation expression, but there is no evidence to support this claim <a title="11279109" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Nasser W,2001</a>  DksA, a protein that is associated with RNA polymerase in regulating transcription, inhibits transcription of <i>fis</i> by increasing the inhibitory effects of ppGpp, decreasing the lifetime of the RNA polymerase-<i>fis</i> promoter complex, and increasing the sensitivity to the CTP nucleotide <a title="16885445" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Mallik P,2006</a>  BipA is a protein required for <i>fis</i> translation; this protein appears to destabilize the strong interaction between the 5¿¿ end of the untranslated region of the <i>fis</i> mRNA and the ribosome <a title="15297874" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">15297874</a>   In a specific way and with tight binding affinity, Fis recognizes and binds as a dimer to sites that have poorly related sequences. However, a very degenerated consensus sequence has been proposed for Fis sites, with only a subset of common nucleotides. This consensus sequence shows a core binding site of 15 bp with partial dyad symmetry <a title="1484481" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Finkel SE,1992</a> This sequence presents only four highly conserved nucleotides, a G and a C at the 1st and at the 15th nucleotide, respectively, and a pyrimidine (A or G) and a purine (T or C) at the 5th and 11th positions, respectively.

DNA replication is also regulated directly by ArgP when the protein binds to three 13-mers located in the origin of replication (OriC), which blocks the DNA opening by DnaA and inhibits this cellular process <a title="2034653, 2208289, 1733927" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Thony B,1991. 2208289. 1733927</a> DNA binding by ArgP is prevented when the serine protease Do (DegP) hydrolyzes this transcriptional regulator <a title="8335089" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8335089</a>.  ArgP was first identified as an inhibitor of <i>oriC</i>-initiated DNA replication <i>in vitro</i>. It has also subsequently been described as a nucleoid-associated protein that shows apparently sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding activity <a title="10551881" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Azam TA,1999</a>  ArgP is a noncanonical regulator, as it binds to a number of additional sites in the genome without an apparent direct regulatory effect, exhibiting low-affinity binding to these additional sites <a title="21890697, 1733927, 21441513" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Marbaniang CN,2011. 1733927.

NlpE, an outer membrane lipoprotein, when overexpressed also stimulates the activity of CpxA <a title="7635808" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Snyder WB,1995</a> and is required for the activation of CpxA in response to adherence to hydrophobic surfaces <a title="11830644" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Otto K,2002</a> or external copper ions <a title="7635807" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gupta SD,1995</a>.  The autokinase activity of CpxA is inhibited by CpxP, a small periplasmic protein that binds to the periplasmic domain of CpxA <a title="17259177" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Fleischer R,2007</a>. This small protein is degraded in turn by the protease DegP in response to PapE/PapG misfolding or to alkaline pH <a title="16166523, 16303867" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Buelow DR,2005. Isaac DD,2005</a>. CpxR activates both the <i>cpxP</i> and <i>degP</i> genes <a title="16861804" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamamoto K,2006</a>.  When CpxA is phosphorylated, its phosphate group is transferred to CpxR to activate it <a title="9401031" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Raivio TL,1997</a>. CpxA is also able to dephosphorylate to CpxR, and it has been suggested that this activity is the default status of CpxA in the absence of strong stress signals <a title="18223085" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">18223085</a>.   On the other hand, CpxR also can be active without activation by CpxA. The PTA-ACK pathway, which converts acetyl-CoA to acetyl-P, ATP, and acetate, activates the CpxR protein without CpxA in response to signals associated with growth and central metabolism <a title="18223085" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">18223085</a>. AcP also functions as a phosphoryl donor to CpxR, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in <i>cpxP</i> repression.  Acetylation of the lysine residue Lys-298 on the surface of the RNAP &alpha;-CTD contributes to promoter activity, and Lys-291 deadens this activation; it also requires Asp-51 of CpxR <a title="22829598, 26790713" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">22829598. 26790713</a>. The conversion of Lys-291 to Gln(&alpha;K29Q), a mimic for acetylation of lysine residue Lys-291 of the RNAP &alpha;-CTD, affects the transcription of <i>cpxP</i> <a title="26790713" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">26790713</a>.  In vitro analysis, to explore cross-talk among proteins of two-component systems, shows that CpxR can dephosphorylate five-histidine kinases, other than CpxA, of two-component systems. However, no kinase other than CpxA is able to phosphorylate CpxR <a title="16487683" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dorel C,2006</a>.  CpxR, like the members of the OmpR subfamily to which it pertains, has a receiver domain at the N terminus and a DNA-binding domain at the C terminus <a title="11226872" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11226872</a>. The proteins of this family appear to function as dimers <a title="17545283" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bachhawat P,2007</a>. They recognize and bind inverted repeats or tandem sequence in DNA. The CpxR box consists of two tandemly organized pentamers separated by 4-8 bp <a title="16861804, 11953442" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamamoto K,2006. De Wulf P,2002</a>.  In addition to Cpx, the systems specifically involved in envelope stress specifically are the Bae system and RpoE stress response system <a title="12354228, 10322173" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Raffa RG,2002. 10322173</a>. The Cpx system is connected to the regulatory networks of RpoH, RpoE, and RpoS. They are sigma factors that are also involved in the stress response. CpxR increases the expression of RpoH and decreases RpoE expression <a title="16952953, 11953442" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zahrl D,2006. De Wulf P,2002</a>.

ECK120011229	FNR	14	inverted-repeat	CRP		ECK12	FNR is the primary transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through the regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism <a title="12754220, 15659690" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Salmon K,2003. Kang Y,2005</a>. FNR also regulates the transcription of many genes with other functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynthesis, among others <a title="12754220, 15659690" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Salmon K,2003. Kang Y,2005</a>.  The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth <a title="15547274" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">15547274</a>, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen. Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of  the protein that causes it to become activated <a title="11581261" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11581261</a>. Purification of [4Fe-4S]-FNR in an O<sub>2</sub>-free environment has been described <a title="19892202" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">19892202</a>. The presence of O<sub>2</sub> results in inactivation of FNR via oxidation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster into the [2Fe-2S] cluster <a title="19261852, 15547274, 9177174" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">19261852. 15547274.

After prolonged O<sub>2</sub> exposure, the [2Fe-2S] cluster is destroyed, and apo-FNR, which lacks an Fe-S cluster, is the primary form of FNR under aerobiosis <a title="18055593, 14730984" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">18055593. 14730984</a>. Nitric oxide (NO) is also able to inactivate FNR through the nitrosylation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, although NO is sensed by other transcription factors, and FNR appears only to function as a final safeguard against NO damage <a title="23471974, 12093725" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">23471974.

Kinetic data showed that cluster sulfide oxidation occurred in parallel with cluster conversion <a title="28373574" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28373574</a>.  Under aerobiosis, the apo-FNR monomer is exposed and can be degraded by the ClpXP protease <a title="16243354" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">16243354</a>. Two motifs of FNR appear to be necessary for this degradation, one located  in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region <a title="16243354" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">16243354</a>.

FNR activates the transcription from class I and class II promoters, in which the FNR-binding sites are located  around -61, -71, -82, or  -92 in class I  and around -41.5 in class II <a title="7592457" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">7592457</a>.  In class I promoters the second N and in class II promoters the third N of the consensus FNR site tend to be an A-T <a title="12706827" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">12706827</a>.  During activation, three activating regions (AR) are surface exposed for contact with the polymerase and promote transcription.

Many of these genes are involved in the catabolism of secondary carbon sources (for reviews, see |CITS: [19033675][18359269][18628769][8394684]|. In addition, CRP is involved in many other processes, such as osmoregulation |CITS: [10601034][16885462]|, stringent response |CITS: [10966109]|, biofilm formation |CITS: [12029060]|, virulence |CITS: [16885462]|, nitrogen assimilation |CITS: [17284458][17233899][11532153]|, iron uptake |CITS: [15659676]|, competence |CITS: [19502395]|, multidrug resistance to antibiotics |CITS: [18503189][16885453]|, and expression of CyaR sRNA |CITS: [18978044]|.

Expression of <i>crp</i> is positively and negatively autoregulated |CITS: [6297782][1328816]|; repression of <i>crp</i> requires Fis |CITS: [9582281]|. CRP plays an important role in persistent cell formation |CITS:[ 26408451]|, as has been shown by activation of a gene potentially related to persistence |CITS: [24509317]|.   CRP was the first purified transcriptional regulator and the first regulator for which the structure was solved |CITS: [4320461][4317918][6261152][6280140][3051048]|. CRP is activated as a DNA-binding protein via binding of its allosteric effector, cAMP |CITS: [4320461][6261152][11890200]|. The hydrogen-bonding abilities of the Thr<sup>127</sup> and Ser<sup>128</sup> residues at the cAMP pocket play a key role in stabilizing the CRP inactive form and in providing high cAMP affinity. However, these residues are not critical for cAMP-induced CRP activation |CITS:[ 26378231]|. The CRP lysine (K100) residue promotes CRP activity at class II promoters and helps to ensure proper CRP steady-state levels. On the other hand, acetylation of this residue is a mechanism by which the cell downregulates CRP-dependent class II promoter activity while elevating CRP steady-state levels, thus indirectly increasing class I promoter activity |CITS:[29105190]|. CRP K100 can be acetylated by <i>acP</i> <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[29105190]|. cAMP-dependent catabolite repression plays a role in the regulation of biofilm growth in response to sugars |CITS:[ 26159080]|.

The crystal structures of cAMP-CRP |CITS: [6286624][2828639][11124031]|, cAMP-CRP bound to DNA |CITS: [1653449][8757802][9096308][23695578]|, the cAMP-CRP-&alpha;-CTD-DNA complex |CITS: [12202833]|, and the solution structure |CITS: [19359484]|, as well as the crystal structure of apo-CRP |CITS: [19805344]|, have been solved. CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region. The C-terminal &alpha;-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif. It dimerizes in apo-CRP, with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core |CITS: [19805344]|. The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of &beta;-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP. A long &alpha;-helix, termed the C-helix, forms an intersubunit coiled-coil. This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP. Allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding, and there are conserved residues crucial for allosteric control |CITS: [24058293]|. After binding of cAMP, the CRP signal is propagated through lengthening and reorientation of the C-helix to the DNA-binding domain, resulting in the liberation of the DNA recognition helix |CITS: [19359484][19805344]|. The CRP C-terminal DNA-binding domain (CDD) is capable of forming a dimer in solution, and this conformation may be involved in cAMP-induced allosteric activation of CRP |CITS:[ 28245055]|.  <b>Mechanism of transcriptional regulation</b>  CRP binds to a 22-bp symmetrical site |CITS: [2557589]| and induces a severe bend upon binding, with an angle of ~80&deg; |CITS: [1653449][8757802][6323997][11724533]|. Two regions of CRP, AR1 ("activation region 1"), located in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [8392187][7966284]|, and AR2 |CITS: [8978616]|, located in the N-terminal domain, are known to interact with RNA polymerase (RNAP).   Promoters that are activated by cAMP-CRP can be grouped into three classes, termed class I, class II, and class III promoters |CITS: [10550204]|. Class I- and class II-dependent promoters require one cAMP-CRP for activation and have a single DNA-binding site located upstream of the RNAP-binding site, centered near position -93, -83, -72, or -62 of class I promoters |CITS: [2173826][2167178][12023077]| and overlapping the RNAP-binding site of class II promoters |CITS: [10550204]|. At class I promoters, AR1 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer interacts with the &alpha;-CTD of RNAP |CITS: [7925296]|, thereby increasing the affinity of RNAP for the promoter DNA |CITS: [1646077][8735277][8394979]|.  Class II-dependent promoters require AR1 of the upstream subunit and AR2 of the downstream subunit of CRP. AR1 recruits &alpha;-CTD to the DNA region upstream of the bound CRP dimer, while AR2 interacts with &alpha;-NTD of RNAP |CITS: [8735277][8978616][9628879]|. Class III promoters require multiple activator molecules, that is, either two or more CAP dimers or one CRP dimer and additional activator proteins synergistically activate transcription |CITS: [15063844][12923087]|. Dependent on the localization of its binding site, CRP functions by a class I or class II mechanism at class III promoters or by a more complex mechanism which can involve direct interactions with the second activator |CITS: [10760178][11742992][16166533]|, or CRP exerts its function by DNA bending |CITS: [8735277][10550204][1848302]|.  CRP represses transcription by promoter occlusion |CITS:[8394684]|, by exclusion of an activator protein |CITS: [2454912]|, through the interaction with a repressor protein in an antiactivation mechanism |CITS: [8394345][8736525][17158559][8969182]| or by hindering promoter clearance |CITS: [15385551][10760580]|.    <b>Catabolite repression and inducer exclusion</b>  Catabolite repression in <i>E. coli</i> is mediated by the interplay of CRP, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system |CITS: [18359269][17158705][18628769]|. Catabolite repression by cAMP/CRP regulates the total carbon uptake flux through a negative feedback loop |CITS:[25862745]|. In the absence of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources, such as glucose, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is phosphorylated |CITS: [9822815]| and activates adenylate cyclase |CITS: [6245052][9457881]|, resulting in an elevated level of cAMP |CITS: [16407219][17675376]|. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i> |CITS: [6297782][7518773][1328816]|, cAMP-CRP levels increase. In addition, in the presence of unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, inducer is transported into the cell, leading to the inactivation of the corresponding repressor molecules |CITS: [2651862]|[<b>Magasanik70</b>*]. Therefore, transcription of catabolic genes is switched on by cAMP-CRP.  If glucose is available, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is predominantly dephosphorylated |CITS: [9822815]|. As a consequence, adenylate cyclase is not activated, resulting in a reduced level of cAMP. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i>, cAMP-CRP levels decrease |CITS: [1715982]|. In addition, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> blocks the uptake of inducer by blocking the transport systems ("inducer exclusion") |CITS: [16453452][7041121][7040431][11969416]|. Thus, transcription of catabolic genes is switched off. cAMP not only mediates carbon metabolism but also plays a physiological role to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic pathways as needed in different nutrient environments |CITS: [23925119]|. &alpha;-Keto-acids inhibit cAMP production |CITS: [23925119]|.   CRP has been adapted to respond to different external and internal stimuli according to the particular ecological niches occupied by the bacterium |CITS: [24509484]|. CRP is a key regulator in metabolism of cell persisters |CITS:[ 25712354]|. CRP has an important role during growth at low temperatures |CITS:[25637299]|.  <b>Mutants</b>  CRP was engineered to prove the enhanced strain osmotolerance phenotype based on several random mutagenesis studies. All variants showed much higher osmotolerance towards NaCl and others osmotic stressors, such as KCl, glucose, and sucrose, than the wild type |CITS: [22179860]|. Using DNA microarray analysis, genes involved in colonic acid biosynthesis were identified as upregulated in the absence of salt stress, whereas carbohydrate metabolism genes were differentially expressed under NaCl stress in MT6 (a CRP mutant with the highest osmotolerance towards NaCl) compared to the wild type |CITS: [22179860]|.  The Gly184 residue of CRP is important to its function as a transcriptional activator, and alteration of this residue affects its DNA binding and probably its RNA polymerase interaction |CITS:[28956357]|.  The growth and the net final biomass produced in a <i>crp</i> single deletion mutant strain growing under anaerobic fermentation conditions were affected relative to responses of the wild-type strain (<i>Escherichia coli</i> strain BW 25113) grown in the same conditions |CITS:[ 28573283]|.

ECK120011250	CadC		inverted-repeat	OmpR		ECK12	CadC is a metal-sensitive transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of genes involved in cadaverine synthesis and excretion under low external pH and high concentrations of lysine <a title="1370290, 8195083, 16491024" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Watson N,1992. 8195083. Kuper C,2005</a>.  Two binding sites for CadC, Cad1 and Cad2, have been determined in the <i>cadBA</i> operon. While Cad1 contains an inverted repeat sequence and has a  preference for AT-rich regions <a title="28432336" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28432336</a>, Cad2 lacks either an inverted repeat or a palindromic sequence. Both binding sites are necessary for <i>cadBA</i> activation. Under aerobic conditions, H-NS represses the <i>cadBA</i> operon. Upon binding to Cad1, CadC releases bound H-NS molecules, dissolving the H-NS repressor complex and allowing RNA polymerase binding. Transcription of <i>cadBA</i> is finally activated once a molecule of CadC binds to Cad2 <a title="16491024" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kuper C,2005</a>.  CadC is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the ToxR-like family of transcriptional activators. It features a cytoplasmic DNA-binding N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a periplasmic C-terminal domain <a title="16491024" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Kuper C,2005</a>. Based on two-hybrid analysis, CadC forms stable dimers in a stimulus- and linker-dependent manner, interacting only at pH 6.8; in addition, lysine is required for transducing the pH-dependent response of the periplasmic sensor into a structural rearrangement that facilitates dimerization of the cytoplasmic CadC DNA-binding domain <a title="25979249" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Buchner S,2015</a>.  Based on mutational analysis, amino acids in the CadC DNA-binding domain (DBD) that are important for DNA recognition and function were identified. CadC utilizes non-sequence-specific and only a few specific interactions for complex formation <a title="28432336" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28432336</a>  In the absence of lysine, LysP regulates CadC negatively <a title="8195083" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8195083</a>. This inhibition is through intramembrane and periplasmic contacts under noninducing conditions. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, Asp275 and Asp278 in LysP and Arg265 and Arg268 in CadC were identified as residues for the stimulus-dependent interaction between them <a title="24056175" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rauschmeier M,2014</a>.  LysP and CadC interact most strongly at pH7.6 and at lysine concentrations of 1 &micro;M or less, that is, under non-Cad-inducing conditions. This interaction is attenuated under Cad-inducing conditions (low pH, increased lysine levels). The LysP-CadC interaction is mediated via trans-membrane and periplasmic contacts <a title="24056175" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rauschmeier M,2014</a>. Oligomerization of LysP is induced at low pH <a title="24056175" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Rauschmeier M,2014</a>. LysP is a trigger transporter <a title="19708919" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">19708919</a>, i.e., a protein that combines regulation and transport functions within the one polypeptide.  At neutral cytoplasmic pH, a disulfide bond is formed in the periplasmic domain of CadC to inactivate it. At low pH, formation of the disulfide bond is prevented, which in turn converts CadC into an active state, but only if lysine is present to inactivate to LysP, the negative regulator of CadC <a title="21486484" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">21486484</a>.

H-NS is capable of inducing severe bends in the DNA, interacting with a large number of DNA regions that contain a planar curvature <a title="2126011, 1745240, 14627810" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Yamada H,1990. 1745240. 14627810</a>. It has been suggested that H-NS binds strongly to sites carrying a 10-bp AT-rich consensus sequence, which functions as a nucleation site for the formation of a repressive higher-order nucleoprotein complex <a title="17881364, 19740756" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Lang B,2007. 19740756</a>. H-NS binds to intergenic regions as well as regions within genes, but not all genes that bind H-NS are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to HN-S in maintenance of nucleoid structure.There is a higher diversity in the sequence of HNS-bound intergenic regions than in HNS-unbound intergenic regions, and that diversity sometimes alters gene expression <a title="26789284" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Higashi K,2016</a> The HNS-bound regions have been conserved through evolution in the <i>E. coli</i> lineage<a title="26789284" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Higashi K,2016</a> Currently, there are different models for the formation of DNA-H-NS-DNA bridges which show that this protein binds in tandem to sequences in the genome, forming multimers <a title="15853876, 17191074, 16879983" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dame RT.,2005. 17191074. Luijsterburg MS,2006</a>.  As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, the expression of <i>hns</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, <i>hns</i> is autoregulated, and it is controlled by different transcription factors. <i>hns</i> is induced by high hydrostatic pressure <a title="8226663" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8226663</a> and DNA synthesis <a title="8596450" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8596450</a>.

It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to StpA <a title="7961433, 1480493" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shi X,1994. 1480493</a> and these two proteins can have similar functions <a title="10515926, 10947847" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">10515926.

StpA appears to be a backup for Hns in the regulation of a set of nonessential and recently acquired genes <a title="23661089" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Srinivasan R,2013</a>.  Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an <i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but the specific mechanisms remain to be determined <a title="7961433, 11278075, 8890170, 8635467, 19151137, 8890170" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Shi X,1994. 11278075.

A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also, there is evidence that these proteins can form homodimers <a title="11244076, 8755860, 10203842, 8755860" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11244076. Williams RM,1996. 10203842. Williams RM,1996</a>. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner <a title="11244076, 10485902" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11244076. 10485902</a>; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS <a title="11244076" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11244076</a>. On the other hand H-NS also may form heterotrimeric complexes with Hha and YdgT <a title="17116239, 15458420" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Madrid C,2007. Paytubi S,2004</a>. It was proposed that Hha enhances the oligomerization of Hns/StpA which is necessary to form DNA-protein filaments to repress transcription <a title="23543115, 23601147" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">23543115. 23601147</a>. The high-resolution structure based on solid-state NMR spectra from full-length H-NS has been determined <a title="23601147" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">23601147</a>.   H-NS is a small protein and it is an abundant nucleic acid protein in the genome, with about 20,000 copies per cell. This regulator belongs to the histone-like family of transcriptional regulators and the structure of the protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker <a title="15100692" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dorman CJ.,2004</a>. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it  is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding <a title="15100692, 10203842, 8755860, 15063845, 19740756" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dorman CJ.,2004. 10203842. Williams RM,1996. 15063845. 19740756</a>. The cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein-protein interactions <a title="24275506" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">24275506</a>.  H-NS forms two compact clusters associated with each copy of the chromosome. These clusters are located near the one-quarter and three-quarter positions along the long axis of the cell <a title="21903814" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang W,2011</a>. In cells with three clusters, the additional cluster tends to appear in the middle <a title="21903814" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang W,2011</a>. The two cluster formations are induced by the N-terminal domain-driven oligomerization of the protein <a title="21903814" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang W,2011</a>. H-NS sequesters the regulated genes and operons into these clusters and juxtaposed numerous DNA segments broadly distributed throughout the chromosome <a title="21903814" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang W,2011</a>. Wang et al. (2011) reported that H-NS clusters could thus serve as anchoring points for numerous DNA loci distributed throughout the genome, creating DNA loops connecting the anchored loci <a title="21903814" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang W,2011</a>.   It was found that the promoter islands, which are regions of DNA containing multiple transcription start sites, are recognized and inactivated by HNS. These promoter islands are associated with genes acquired horizontally <a title="23717391" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">23717391</a>.  Based on ChIP-chip and chip-seq analysis, it was proved that Rho-dependent termination abrogates the H-NS-DNA interactions, leading to transcriptional derepression of H-NS-silenced genes <a title="24499790" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">24499790</a>.

On the other hand, LrhA also regulates negatively and partially the translation of <i>rpoS</i> through two mechanisms, one of which is RprA dependent and the other one is RprA independent. RprA is a small RNA that regulates positively the translation of <i>rpoS</i>. Both mechanisms of regulation require the presence of the sRNA chaperone Hfq; therefore, it was suggested that another small RNA, in addition to RprA, that regulates <i>rpoS</i> translation is regulated by LrhA <a title="16621809" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">16621809</a>.  LrhA is a protein that belongs to the LysR family and, like the members of this family, LrhA contains three different domains: an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain for DNA binding, a coinducer recognition domain in the center of the protein, and a C-terminal domain that contains a cluster of four cysteine and two histidine residues <a title="7565112" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bongaerts J,1995</a>.

The L1 loop is known to interact with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, presumably with region I of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. Zhang et al.

DnaA is a central focus for regulation of this initiation process, maintaining the critical ratio of one initiation of DNA replication per cell division. As a consequence, a number of factors feed into the regulation of both DnaA abundance and activity, yielding an integrated control over this core cellular process.  Recent reviews: |CITS: [24747048][29312202][29357054]|  DnaA interacts with <i>oriC</i> via binding at short DNA sequences known as "DnaA boxes" |CITS: [7615570][2542031][6091903][6310593][9297181]|. Prior to the start of the replication initiation process, DnaA monomers are bound to three high-affinity sites within <i>oriC</i>. As the replication initiation process begins, DnaA oligomerizes, apparently "spidering out" from these high-affinity sites to facilitate binding of the low-affinity DnaA boxes |CITS: [19833870][10234818][9351837]|. IHF binds at the same time as this shift from high- to low-affinity sites occurs, enhancing binding by DnaA to these low-affinity boxes |CITS: [10692160][12366835]|. DnaA-ATP binds with somewhat greater affinity to the general <i>oriC</i> region than DnaA-ADP |CITS: [11250912]|. This appears to be the consequence of a handful of "initiator" or DnaA boxes within <i>oriC</i> which have a four-fold higher affinity for DnaA-ATP over DnaA-ADP |CITS: [14978287][16298387]|. In line with the model of these particular DnaA boxes being gatekeepers for initiation of replication, <i>E. coli</i> win which normal DnaA boxes have been replaced with additional "initiator" sequences are subject to asynchronous and overly frequent replication initiation |CITS: [17850252]|. More generally, all the DnaA boxes in <i>oriC</i> play a role in proper regulation of initiation, as does their spacing and orientation |CITS: [8858585][7667087][8022267][1603077][1291230][2830261]|.   The transition between the "closed" and "open" origin is made sharper by the coordinated action of Fis, IHF, and DnaA. Fis initially blocks access by both IHF and DnaA, but as DnaA abundance increases, Fis is kicked off and IHF and DnaA bind the remaining DnaA boxes <i>en masse</i>, starting the opening process |CITS: [14982629]|. Once <i>oriC</i> has begun to unwind, DnaA-ATP binds with significantly higher affinity to the newly revealed single-stranded DNA than to the remaining double-stranded DNA, whereas DnaA-ADP shows no difference in affinity |CITS: [11250912]|.  After unwinding the double helix at <i>oriC</i>, DnaA faciliates the loading of the replicative helicase DnaB onto two nascent replication forks. DnaA binds to DnaB, bringing it into the area of the unwound <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [8106460][627535]|. The complete "prepriming complex" involves 10 DnaA monomers and 2 DnaB hexamers per <i>oriC</i>, meaning that there is one replicative helicase (DnaB hexamer) per new replication fork |CITS: [11551962]|. Although the binding of DnaB and its loader to the <i>oriC</i> region depends on having available single-stranded DNA from the newly unwound helix, DnaA binding does not, meaning that in the prepriming complex DnaA monomers are bound to both the wound and unwound regions of the origin |CITS: [12161435]|. Although there will eventually be a helicase loaded onto each replication fork, loading that is directly attributable to the DnaA-DnaB interaction only occurs on one of the two strands |CITS: [12421318]|. Presumably the replication bubble is effectively "held open" by the first helicase loaded, allowing access for a second one.   Following the generation of this <i>oriC</i>-DnaB prepriming complex, DnaA's role in initiation is complete and it is no longer required |CITS: [2153124]|.  DnaA oligomerizes extensively as part of carrying out its role in initiating replication |CITS: [15878847]|. The final prepriming complex has been reported to comprise 10-30 DnaA monomers, with complete occupancy of all <i>oriC</i> DnaA boxes |CITS: [11551962][8663334][12864864]|. As described above, this oligomerization process appears to start with binding at high-affinity DnaA boxes followed by "spidering" out to lower-affinity sites across the whole of <i>oriC</i>. Proper oligomerization and subsequent opening of <i>oriC</i> depends on DiaA, which forms a tetramer that binds multiple DnaA monomers, suggesting that DiaA may act as a coordinator of DnaA oligomers |CITS: [15326179][17699754]|. DiaA appears unlikely to be part of some sort of DnaA-DiaA complex, as DiaA blocks DnaB loading, implying that at some point after oligomerization of DnaA, DiaA exits the picture |CITS: [19632993]|.  Initiation of DNA replication has been proposed to be regulated by several mechanisms that operate through DnaA and <i>oriC</i>. These include control over the ATP/ADP status of DnaA, sequestering of the origin of replication, and titration of available DnaA.  The ATP- versus ADP-bound status of DnaA has a major impact on its ability to operate as an initiator of DNA replication. Although DnaA binds both ATP and ADP with high affinity, only the ATP-bound form is able to initiate replication under normal circumstances, as described above |CITS: [3036372][9125116][2835363]|. This difference is not due to binding, as both forms can bind at <i>oriC</i>, but instead is a function of DnaA-ATP being the only form with the ability to prompt unwinding of the double helix |CITS: [8377183]|. Averaged across the entire cell cycle, some 15-30% of all DnaA is typically in ATP-bound form. This abundance rises across the course of the cell cycle, topping out at about 80% just ahead of DNA division and cell division |CITS: [10581238]|.  The primary limiter of the abundance of DnaA-ATP is the DnaA regulator Hda, acting in concert with the beta clamp of DNA Pol III |CITS: [7721846][9473485][9674428][10581238][16882985]|. Hda acts as a bridge between the beta clamp of the polymerase and DnaA. Two Hda homodimers bind per clamp via the Hda amino-terminus, and then Hda interacts with DnaA via the DnaA amino-terminus. When this complexing occurs, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated, converting DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP |CITS: [15150238][15611053][11254969]|. ATP hydrolysis is inhibited when DnaA is bound to a DnaA box, but this inhibition is overcome by Hda-clamp binding and active DNA synthesis |CITS: [15189445][11309120]|. This suggests that either this interaction is tethering DnaA to non-DnaA-box DNA, or that it may let the DNA polymerase complex drag DnaA off of a DnaA box. This conversion of DnaA-ATP to its ADP state is required to prevent  premature or asynchronous initiation of DNA replication |CITS: [15939703][16041320][16321957][12730188][11483528]|.  DnaA-ADP is regenerated to its ATP-bound form via an interaction with phospholipids. Cardiolipin and various unsaturated fatty acids in relatively fluid membranes dissociate ADP from DnaA, leaving DnaA available for binding by new ATP |CITS: [2835364][8227025]|. Phospholipids lacking unsaturated fatty acids only poorly promote the release of ADP |CITS: [2845401]|. DnaA binding to <i>oriC</i> is important for stabilizing the protein during this process |CITS: [1512219]|. Conversely, the presence of various phospholipids in advance of binding blocks <i>oriC</i> binding by DnaA |CITS: [12366847]|. The carboxy-terminal portion of DnaA appears to actually enter the membrane during this regeneration process |CITS: [9478970]|. This aligns well with the observation that DnaA localizes to the cell membrane |CITS: [10762265]|.  The regeneration of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP is also promoted by two intergenic regions on the chromosome labeled DARS1 and DARS2. Each of these regions contains many DnaA sites, promoting the oligomerization of DnaA in such a manner as to enhance the release of ADP |CITS: [19401329]|.  Newly synthesized DNA within <i>oriC</I> and the nearby <i>dnaA</i> locus remains hemimethylated significantly longer than other newly synthesized DNA. This was originally proposed as a mechanism of delaying initiation of new DNA replication, as hemimethylated DNA is not transcription competent |CITS: [1697508]|. Based on analyses carried out using <i>oriC</i> DNA on a plasmid SeqA was observed to bind this hemimethylated DNA and inhibit DnaA binding |CITS: [11122375]|. However, mutants lacking any <I>seqA</i> activity see only a modest increase in initiation of replication, and methylation state of sites within the <i>dnaA</i> promoter region has no impact on replication timing |CITS: [16041320][16740964]|. It does appear that SeqA facilitates <i>oriC</i> reset by blocking access of DnaA to the low-affinity DnaA boxes that are typically only occupied during the initiation of replication |CITS: [17114060]|.  There are a number of other DnaA boxes throughout the <i>E. coli</i> genome beyond those within contained <i>oriC</i> and the DARS regions. One theory of regulation of DnaA activity as an initiator of DNA replication is that DnaA monomers are titrated out by binding to many of these alternate DnaA boxes. The major proposed DnaA titration site is datA. The datA site contains multiple DnaA boxes, and titrates out DnaA in a box-dependent manner. Mutations within this site lead to asynchronous and overly frequent initiation of DNA replicatio|CITS: [9765205][11690638][12068813]|. When additional datA sites are introduced into <I>E. coli</i>, DNA replication and cell division are delayed, followed by an induced SOS response and incomplete replication at especially high doses of datA |CITS: [14507385]|. However, given that cells are viable and DNA replication can be initiated in the absence of a datA site, it has been suggested that the role of datA titration of DnaA is in timing of initiation relative to cell growth, rather than in blocking incorrect initiation completely |CITS: [15939703][16041320]|. The DnaA boxes involved in titrating DnaA are structurally distinct from those involved in binding of oligomeric DnaA to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [17316685]|. However, much like <i>oriC</i>, the DnaA boxes within datA contain an interstitial IHF binding region which must be intact to allow proper function of datA in regulating replication initiation |CITS: [19170757]|.  DnaA is presented at approximately 800-2,100 molecules per cell. Although this number varies across different <i>E. coli</i> strains, it appears to be fairly consistent across differing growth conditions within a given strain |CITS: [1860829]|.  DnaA is involved in a number of processes beyond cellular DNA replication. DnaA is required for replication of many plasmids, including pSC101, pBR322, ColE1, F plasmid, R1, RK2, and mini-F plasmids such as pSC183, pKP1013, and pKV513 |CITS: [6091903][3020005][3931918][3037524][2820940][2844794]|. Mutations in <i>dnaA</I> can also lead to a decrease in linking number in resident plasmids |CITS: [8573119]|. It is also involved in the life cycle of phages such as f1, lambda, and Coliphage 186, as well as being required for robust Tn5 transposition |CITS: [4601460][7033562][2820938][7867947][9819062]|.  DnaA is subject to autoregulation, as increased abundance of DnaA represses transcription of <i>dnaA</i> |CITS: [2995766][2981626][3025553][2828882][8407830]|. This occurs via binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes at the <i>dnaA</i> locus, where the DnaA-DnaA box complex directly blocks transcription |CITS: [2854096][2548849][2088506][8995231]|. An internal DnaA box within the actual <i>dnaA</i> gene appears to play no role in modulating transcription, however, and it has been suggested that at least one other DnaA box at the locus is also dispensible for autoregulation |CITS: [7896719][9106220]|.  Binding of DnaA to other DnaA boxes can similarly impact regulation of other genes, including <i>rpoH</i> and <i>guaA</i> |CITS: [2540187][1736096]|.  The structure of DnaA has been examined in great detail, with an emphasis on how it relates to DnaA's function within the cell.  The amino-terminal portion of DnaA is required for replication, but not for ATP or <i>oriC</i> binding |CITS: [9852089]|. This requirement for replication is likely due to the fact that the amino-terminal domain is both necessary and sufficient for oligomerization of DnaA, and is required for the interaction between DnaA and DnaB |CITS: [10540285][10972842]|. The amino-terminal region contains a number of residues whose hydrophobicity is required for proper DnaA function |CITS: [12132668]|. The flexible linker Domain II within DnaA has been evaluated via systematic deletion, revealing a minimum length requirement of 21-27 residues |CITS: [18957591]|. This domain is required for recruiting DnaB to <i>oriC</i> |CITS: [19546317]|. The Box VII domain within DnaA is required for oligomerization |CITS: [15371441]|. Phospholipid binding occurs via the region comprising residues 115-381 |CITS: [8670850][11102450]|. This region is an amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane to activate the release of ADP |CITS: [9786858]|. ATP binding takes place near K415, R328, and K372 |CITS: [11700030][11853554]|. The carboxy-terminal 94 amino acids are both necessary and sufficient for binding to DnaA boxes in general and <i>oriC</i> in particular. This binding domain contains three &alpha; helices |CITS: [7744016][9417934][10844646]|.   Circular dichroism and NMR analysis of the DNA-binding domain of DnaA has been carried out |CITS: [12435387]|. NMR analysis has also identified the specific binding surface within this DNA binding domain |CITS: [14523560]|. The DnaA amino-terminal region has also been evaluated via NMR |CITS: [17420252]|.  The crystal structure of DnaA's DNA-binding domain complexed with an example DnaA box has been resolved to 2.1 &Aring; resolution |CITS: [12682358]|.  An experimental molecular weight of 48 kD has also been reported for DnaA |CITS: [6258023]|. 	Local Regulator	Using internal synthesized signals	TTATCCACA

ECK120012029	PutA	6	asymmetric	PutA		ECK12	PutA is a flavoprotein with mutually exclusive functions as a transcriptional repressor and membrane-associated enzyme.  The switch between the two activities is due to conformational changes triggered by the redox state of FAD.  In the presence of proline, PutA is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of the |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| pathway: the oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase.  The kinetics of the coupled reaction is best described by substrate channeling.  In the absence of proline, PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>put</i> regulon.    The N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain the dimerization domain and the specific DNA-binding activity of PutA <a title="15155740, 18586269, 22013066" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gu D,2004. Zhou Y,2008. 22013066</a>.  The Lys9 residue is essential for recognition of <i>put</i> promoter DNA <a title="17001030" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">17001030</a>.  Crystal structures of this domain have been solved <a title="17001030, 18586269" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">17001030. Zhou Y,2008</a>.  In the absence of proline, PutA binds to operator sequences in the <i>putA</i>-<i>putP</i> intergenic region and represses transcription, most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to the <i>putA</i> promoter <a title="18586269" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Zhou Y,2008</a>.  The membrane-associated form of PutA does not bind <i>put</i> promoter DNA; thus, the enzymatic and DNA-binding activities of PutA are mutually exclusive <a title="15476410" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">15476410</a>.  The proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) activity resides in the amino-terminal domain following the DNA-binding domain; a truncated protein containing residues 1-669 retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity, but lacks membrane association and &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity <a title="12009917" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Vinod MP,2002</a>.  Proline dehydrogenase activity requires the presence of an electron acceptor.  The reaction is split into a reductive half reaction (reduction of the FAD cofactor by oxidation of proline) and an oxidative half reaction (reoxidation of reduced |FRAME: FADH2| by transfer of electrons to the quinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane) <a title="6305659" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">6305659</a>.  The proline:ubiquinone oxidoreductase reaction proceeds via a rapid equilibrium ping-pong mechanism with proline and ubiquinone binding at two distinct sites <a title="22040654" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Moxley MA,2011</a>.  Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of both half reactions indicate that reoxidation of the flavin cofactor is rate-limiting <a title="22148640" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">22148640</a>.  The conserved H487 residue is critical for reversibility of the PRODH reaction as well as the kinetics of the conformational change and functional switching to the transcription factor activity <a title="28558236" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28558236</a>.  Association of the enzyme with the membrane is dependent on reduction of the FAD cofactor, which induces a change in the conformation of the protein <a title="3540963, 8473341, 12731889" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">3540963. 8473341. 12731889</a>.

These studies resulted in a detailed picture of the mechanism of the redox-dependent structural changes of the protein and identified Y540 as an important substrate specificity determinant.  A model of the entire protein including small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data shows that PutA is a symmetric V-shaped dimer.  Parts of the C-terminal domain may function as a lid that covers the internal substrate-channeling cavity <a title="22013066" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">22013066</a>.  The C-terminal domain shows similarity to aldehyde dehydrogenases, indicating that the true substrate for the second enzymatic activity may be &gamma;-glutamamate semialdehyde, which is thought to spontaneously equilibrate with &Delta;<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) <a title="7966312" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Ling M,1994</a>.

ECK120012316	AraC	17	inverted-repeat	AraC/XylS		ECK12	The "<b>ara</b>binose regulator," AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC <a title="9409145, 1744033, 6319708, 1400237, 9600836, 2231717, 6377308" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gallegos MT,1997.

On the other hand, CRP alone is unable to activate transcription of <i>rha</i> operons in the absence of RhaS. Therefore, these two regulators bind cooperatively to fully activate the operons related with transport and degradation of L-rhamnose <a title="16166533, 8230210, 8757746, 10852886" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wickstrum JR,2005.

In this way, RhaS activates transcription of L-rhamnose gene clusters.  This transcription factor is composed of two domains, a C-terminal domain that contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs and an N-terminal domain involved in L-rhamnose binding and dimerization of the protein <a title="15342598, 18366439, 17513476" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wickstrum JR,2004.

ECK120012595	Ada	24	inverted-repeat	AraC/XylS		ECK12	<i>ada</i> encodes a bifunctional methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator which is a key component of the adaptive response - the mechanism of adaption induced after exposure to small amounts of DNA alkylating agents.   O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (O<sup>6</sup>--meG) and O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine (O<sup>4</sup>-meT)  are two of a number of nucleobase modifications that result from exposure of DNA to alkylating agents - both chemical [eg. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), methane methanesulfonate (MMS)] and endogenous; O<sup>6</sup>-meG and O<sup>4</sup>-meT modifications constitute potentially mutagenic lesions due to their tendency to mispair with thymine and with guanine, respectively, inducing transition mutations (reviewed in <a title="17173371, 17823664" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">17173371. 17823664</a>.

Based on the crystal structure, it was reported that there are two possible salicylate sites, SAL-A and SAL-B, in MarR [Alekshun01].

On the other hand, based on mutational analysis of the MarR homologue MTH313 from <i>Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum</i>, residues P57, R86, M74, and R77 were found important for DNA binding; residues R16, D26, and K44 significantly reduced binding to either salicylate or 2,4-dinitrophenol, and residue H19 impaired the binding to 2,4-dinitrophenol. These findings indicate, as with MTH313, the presence of a ligand-binding pocket located between the dimerization and DNA-binding domains [Duval13]. For inactivation of MarR by salicylate, 2-4-dinitrophenol, or plumbagin, most of the residues important for ligand effectiveness lie in the &alpha;1 and &alpha;2 helices of MarR, between the putative DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain of MarR <a title="24111786" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">24111786</a>  2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), anthranilate, and 4-hydroxybenzoate (in the absence of TolC), which are involved in enterobactin, tryptophan, and ubiquinone biosynthesis, respectively, can activate <i>marRAB</i> transcription.

SoxR contains two essential [2Fe-2S] clusters for its transcriptional activity <a title="11179804" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">11179804</a>.  Each SoxR polypeptide contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster that senses the oxidants in the cell.  Both Fe-SoxR and apo-SoxR bind to the promoter region, but only Fe-SoxR contributes to the activation in its oxidized form  <a title="8790350, 8816757, 8306957, 7673113, 8631739" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8790350. 8816757. 8306957.

SoxR contains two critical amino acids around the [2Fe-2S] binding site (RL126R/V130P) and also R127L and P131V substitutions in EcSoxR, which cause a more electropositive environment around [2Fe-2S], making oxidation more difficult <a title="25998932" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">25998932</a>.

ECK120023539	NikR	28	inverted-repeat	CopG		ECK12	NikR, "<b>Ni</b>c<b>k</b>el-<b>r</b>esponsive repressor," is a tetramer and consists of two domains. The crystal structures of the C-terminal domain, apo-NikR, nickel-activated NikR, and NikR in complex with its operator DNA have been solved <a title="12970756, 16945905, 18193897" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Schreiter ER,2003. 16945905. 18193897</a>. The C-terminal 83 amino acids form the tetrameric core, which carries the high-affinity nickel-binding site and resembles the ACT fold of the ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate mutase, TyrA) family. Two N-terminal domains intertwine to form a dimeric DNA-binding ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain <a title="10595554" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Chivers PT,1999</a>. The two RHH DNA-binding domains flank the tetrameric core of the protein <a title="16945905" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">16945905</a>.  The NikR tetramer contains four high-affinity nickel-binding sites located at the subunit interfaces of the C-terminal domain and additional low-affinity metal-binding sites <a title="12401498, 12401490, 17397155, 18379702, 16945905, 15287730" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">12401498. 12401490. 17397155.

ECK120030264	AlaS	7	inverted-repeat	Class II aminoacyl_tRNA synthetase		ECK12	Alanine&mdash;tRNA ligase (AlaRS) is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which interpret the genetic code by covalently linking amino acids to their specific tRNA molecules.  The reaction is driven by ATP hydrolysis.  AlaRS belongs to the Class IIC aminoacyl tRNA synthetases <a title="2203971, 1852601, 23075299" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Eriani G,1990. 1852601. 23075299</a>.  AlaRS was seen as a homotetramer in solution <a title="7005211" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Putney SD,1981</a>.  Later experiments determined that AlaRS is homodimeric in solution <a title="21985608" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Dignam JD,2011</a> and can exist in an equilibrium between a homodimeric and a homodecameric state, depending on temperature <a title="8645007, 9343380" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">8645007. 9343380</a>.

Kinetic parameters for binding of AlaRS to tmRNA have been determined <a title="10704215" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">10704215</a>.  The central domain of AlaRS is the editing domain.  Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been shown to have editing functions.  AlaRS misactivates glycine and serine, but has a pre-transfer editing function, hydrolyzing the non-cognate amino acid before transfer to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, and a post-transfer editing function that deacetylates mischarged tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <a title="6117825, 12949076" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Tsui WC,1981. 12949076</a>.

The site-directed mutants Q584H, I667E, and C666A have decreased editing activity; interestingly, the C666A mutation is 1.7-fold more active on Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> than on the mischarged Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <a title="21241052" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">21241052</a>.  A homologous free-standing protein with editing activity, AlaX, exists in other organisms; the protein family may have evolved from an ancestral form that was able to deacylate multiple tRNAs <a title="25724653" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">25724653</a>.  |FRAME: CPLX0-3581| is able to edit Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> more efficiently than AlaRS <a title="28362257" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pawar KI,2017</a>.  The C-terminal domain (C-Ala) plays a role in activating the catalytic sites of the N-terminal domain <a title="6200234" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">6200234</a>.  C-Ala represents the major tRNA binding module of AlaRS <a title="19661429" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">19661429</a>; this tRNA binding activity is required for efficient editing activity by the central editing domain <a title="18172502" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Beebe K,2008</a>.  The C-Ala domain serves to bring the aminoacylation and editing domains of AlaRS together to bind to the acceptor stem of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> <a title="19661429" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">19661429</a> and is important for dimerization of the enzyme <a title="26617997" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">26617997</a>.  AlaRS represses transcription of the <i>alaS</i> gene by binding to a region flanking the transcription start site, and thus autoregulates its own expression.  The autoregulatory effect depends on the concentration of alanine, with higher concentrations leading to lower levels of <i>alaS</i> transcription.  At physiological levels of AlaRS, repression of <i>alaS</i> transcription is solely mediated by alanine levels <a title="6264314" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Putney SD,1981</a>.

An RcnR structure study showed that it has a charged N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34), followed by a highly conserved region of primarily nonpolar amino acids (35-64), that is, a region probably involved in binding metals. The N terminus determines metal-specific responses via recognition of cognate and noncognate metals <a title="22471551" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">22471551</a>. Replacement of the Arg-14 and Lys-17 residues on RcnR affects its DNA-binding affinity <a title="29150441" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">29150441</a> Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any &beta;-sheet <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>.

RcnR is not similar to any other known transcriptional regulator; instead, it is homologous to other proteins whose genes are encoded next to genes encoding putative metal efflux proteins, metalloenzymes, or copper chaperones [and just a few (13%) of the homologs to cardiolipin synthases or membrane proteins] <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. Such conserved localization with genes of metal-related functions suggests that these homologs are likely to play a regulatory role in metal homeostasis <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>.   RcnR acts as a transcriptional repressor for its divergent <i>rcnA</i> gene <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a> and a weak repressor for its own expression <a title="19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009</a>. In response to increasing concentrations of nickel or cobalt, RcnR releases the repression of <i>rcnA</i> and <i>rcnR</i> to allow its expression <a title="16956381, 19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006. Iwig JS,2009</a>. As <i>rcnR</i> expression is induced in response to iron even in the absence of Fur <a title="17120142" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Koch D,2007</a>, it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly.   RcnR binds to two sites in the <i>rcnA-rcnR</i>  intergenic region with the sequence TACT-G(6)-N-AGTA <a title="19703465, 16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009. Iwig JS,2006</a>. The TACT inverted repeats are critical for specific binding. The G-tracts provide a structural component to facilitate binding of RcnR to DNA, because they endow A-form DNA characteristics to the RcnR operators. In addition, RcnR interacts nonspecifically with the approximately 50 bp flanking the core binding site, resulting in DNA wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid DNA <a title="19703465" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2009</a>. RcnR forms a stable tetramer and binds as a tetramer to one operator. The tetrameric state is not perturbed by Ni(II) or Co(II) binding <a title="18505253" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">18505253</a>.   Based on a computational model of apo-<i>Ec</i>RcnR in the tetrameric state, using experimental data it was determined that the model shows a large number of putative metal-binding residues localized at the interface between two monomers in the vicinity of Cys35 from one chain; the N-terminal amine and the imidazole rings of His3, His64, His67, and His60, known to be involved in metal binding, are all found in this region. In addition, Glu34 and Glu63 are also located in this potential metal-loading region, and their carboxylate groups could act as ligands for Co(II) and Ni(II) <a title="28517938" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28517938</a>.  <b>X</b>-ray <b>a</b>bsorption <b>s</b>pectroscopy (XAS) analysis confirmed that both the Glu34 and Glu63 are ligands in the Co(II) complex, while for Ni(II), only Glu63 unambiguously acts as a ligand <a title="28517938" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">28517938</a>.  As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a> showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>. Also, RcnA is important in the modulation of the hydrogenase assembly pathway through the NikR regulation that limits nickel delivery to the process, repressing <i>nikABCDE</i> transporter expression when intracellular nickel levels are high <a title="16956381" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Iwig JS,2006</a>.

YqjI is inactivated under conditions of elevated nickel levels, and the presence of this divalent metal prevents its binding to the target gene. Thus, this regulator maintains the iron homeostasis during high levels of nickel <a title="21097627" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Wang S,2011</a> However, in vitro studies have shown that YqjI can be affected by other divalent metals.

IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes <a title="15102446, 1447969, 11827473" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">15102446. Freundlich M,1992. 11827473</a>  IHF is highly abundant in the cell. Its total intracellular concentration varies with growth rate and is higher in exponential phase, with 6,000 dimers per cell, than in stationary phase (3,000 dimers per cell) <a title="10515926" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">10515926</a>  IHF acts mostly as an accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex. For example, IHF was originally found to be required for the site-specific recombination of phage &lambda; with the chromosome <a title="6251971" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">6251971</a> For this, IHF stabilizes the bending of the DNA to facilitate binding of the bivalent integrase molecules <a title="2544029" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">2544029</a> As another example, IHF stimulates transcription at &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters.

Each monomer consists of three domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain carrying two helix-turn-helix motifs, a central dimerization domain, and a C-terminal metal-binding domain. The DNA-binding and dimerization domains are characteristic of the MerR family of proteins. The dimerization domain contains a 10-turn &alpha;-helix that forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with the helix of the other monomer. The metal-binding domain contains an unusual metal receptor site in which the bound metal is inaccessible to the solvent. The metal ion is bound with a linear coordination to two conserved cysteine residues. This dithiolate coordination confers the metal ion selectivity for +1 ions <a title="12958362" href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Changela A,2003</a>. The sensitivity of CueR for copper(I) ions is extremely high (in the zeptomolar range), which corresponds to less than one atom per cell.
