b0795	ybhG	"putative membrane fusion protein (MFP) component of efflux pump, membrane anchor; Putative membrane fusion protein (MFP), function unknown; probable exporter YbhGFSR; signal anchor; The putative ybiHybhGFSR operon encodes a predicted transcriptional regulator (YbiH) and four proteins of a predicted ABC-type transporter complex YbhGFSR, containing two ABC permease family members (YbhSR), a predicted ATP-binding cassette protein (YbhF), and a predicted membrane fusion protein (YbhG) usually associated with RND-type efflux pumps. No predicted periplasmic binding protein is associated with this predicted ABC transporter YbhGFSR, suggesting that it is an exporter, which is consistent with the presence of a membrane fusion protein (YbhG) allowing for export transit across the periplasm. YbhG (f332) was mistakenly predicted to be a periplasmic binding protein (noted as subfamily ""v""), leading to the mis-classification of YbhGFSR as a putative importer (Linton, 1998).

b1381	ydbH	YdbH has been extensively mislabeled as a dicarboxylate transport family protein due to misannotations in three database profiles, namely Pfam PF11739, CDD cl14674, and InterPro IPR021730. YdbH has no similarities to any Dct transporters and is not predicted to be an integral membrane protein, although it does have a predicted N-terminal membrane anchor. The mislabeling of E. coli YdbH predicted function has arisen because the ygene naming systems for E. coli and B. subtilus, widely propagated to other Gram (-) and Gram (+) genomes, respectively, were developed independently and have many ygenes of the same name but share no homologous or functional relationships; the original ygene name for B. subtilus dctA was ydbH.

b2077	mdtD	"putative multidrug efflux pump MdtD; putative citrate/iron-citrate/zinc-citrate efflux transporter; Putative citrate/iron-citrate/zinc-citrate efflux transporter; putative arabinose exporter; Salmonella IceT(MdtD) has been characterized as a citrate and iron-citrate efflux transporter (Frawley, 2013). iceT(mdtD) mutants grow slower in the presence of zinc at high cell density and have a dramatically increased intracellular free zinc concentration after zinc shock, indicating that IceT may export zinc-citrate; the authors note that ""it is likely that zinc is co-transported in a complex with other ligands that are substrates of MdtD"" (Wang, 2013). Plasmid-mediated mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) overexpression confers resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant background but the same resistances are observed with mdtABC overexpression, indicating that iceT(mdtD) does not confer multidrug resistance (Nishino, 2001; Nagakubo, 2002). Chromosomal mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) expression induced by plasmid-mediated BaeR overproduction increases resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant; mutations in mdtB and mdtC but not iceT(mdtD) abolish this BaeR-induced resistance phenotype (Baranova, 2002).

MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC transporter import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009). The first 21 aa are predicted to be a Type I signal peptide.

b3485	yhhJ	ABC transporter family protein YhhJ; putative ABC transporter permease; Putative ABC transporter permease; The yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon encodes RbbA, an ABC transporter ATPase/permease fusion protein homolog that does not appear to be a transporter but rather is a ribosome-associated ATPase, and the YhiI membrane fusion efflux protein (MFP) homolog. The associations or roles, if any, that YhiI and YhhJ might have in RbbA function is unknown, but it is possible that YhiI-RbbA-YhhJ is or was an exporter. YadH, YbhR, YbhS, YhhJ, and the RbbA C-terminal domain are paralogous ABC2-membrane permease family members (pfam01061/COG0842).

b3487	yhiI	"putative membrane fusion protein (MFP) of efflux pump; Predicted membrane fusion protein (MFP) of efflux pump; function unknown; signal anchor; The yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon also encodes RbbA, an ABC transporter ATPase/permease fusion protein homolog that does not appear to be a transporter but rather is a ribosome-associated ATPase, and the YhhJ ABC transporter permease that is paralogous to the RbbA C-terminal permease domain. The associations or roles, if any, that YhiI and YhhJ might have in RbbA function is unknown, but it is possible that YhiI-RbbA-YhhJ is or was an exporter. The YhiI MFP was mistakenly predicted to be a periplasmic binding protein (noted as subfamily ""v""), leading to the mis-classification of RbbA(YhiGH)-YhhJ-YhiI as a putative importer (Linton, 1998). Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture. YhiI has a predicted 23 aa signal anchor.

b3507	dctR	A dctR mutation reverses the succinate growth defect of an atp operon deletion resulting in a Suc+ growth phenotype; DctA overproduction also confers Suc+ to the atp deletion strain; cloned dctR complements the dctR mutant Suc+ phenotype restoring the Suc- phenotype conferred by the atp deletion; it was proposed that DctR(YhiF) is a repressor for the dctA gene and that yhiF be renamed as DctR (Boogerd, 1998). E. coli K-12 has other known and putative dicarboxylate transporters such as DcuAB, CitT and YbhI that were not tested for suppression of the Suc- phenotype, and DctR was not shown to be a dctA repressor, so DctR could be repressing a dicarboxylate transporter gene other than dctA. dctR and slp are in the AFI 12 gene acid fitness island and their roles in acids resistance are to counter the effects of organic acids in spent medium; a slp-dctR(yhiF) double mutant, but not either single mutant, loses protection against metabolites that are toxic at pH 2.5 including formate, succinate, and lactate, but not acetate; the double mutant phenotype can be complemented by a yhiF clone but complementation by a slp clone was not tested; this implies that Slp and DctR provide redundant protection; the protective role for DctR during the acid resistance response may be repression of one or more C4-dicarboxylate importers; a dctA mutant did not alter the slp-dctR phenotype, indicating that other C4-dicarboxylate importers in addition to or instead of DctA may be repressed by DctR (Mates, 2007). Overexpression of DctR causes filamentous biofilm formation (Tenorio, 2003). DctR is possibly involved in the regulation of type III secretion systems in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (Tatsuno, 2003). dctR is part of the EvgAS regulon (Masuda, 2002). Greater than 92% of the upstream slp mRNA is monocistronic and it is not known if all dctR expression is based on readthrough of the slp terminator or if dctR also has its own promoter (Alexander, 1994; Tucker, 2003).

b3547	yhjX	putative pyruvate transporter;  putative MFS antiporter, pyruvate-inducible; Putative MFS antiporter, pyruvate-inducible; inner membrane protein; The YpdAB-regulated transporter gene yhjX is induced by high (>600 micromolar) concentrations of pyruvate while the BtsSR-regulated high-affinity pyruvate symporter gene btsT is induced by low (<5 micromolar) concentrations of pyruvate (Behr, 2017b). YhjX is the only protein directly regulated by the pyruvate-sensing YpdAB two-component system: response regulator YpdB binds to the yhjX promoter region, YpdB overproduction increased yhjX expression 24-fold, and deletion of ypdABC prevented induction by the pyruvate in LB; the induction was restored by a ypdAB clone; YpdB overproduction indrectly increased btsT(yjiY) expression 4-fold since btsT(yjiY) has no YpdB binding site (Fried, 2013). yhjX expression increased 50-fold in a btsSR(yehUT) mutant, but yhjX is indirectly repressed since BtsR(YehT) does not bind the yhjX promoter region (Kraxenberger, 2012). YhjX has been experimentally shown to be an integral membrane protein (Daley, 2005; Fried, 2013). The YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate btsT(yjiY), directly by BtsSR(YehUT) and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by BtsSR(YehUT) and directly by YpdAB; the transporter genes yhjX and btsT(yjiY) are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) (Fried, 2013). YhjX is similar to OxlT from Oxalobacter genes and may be an oxalate-formate antiporter; alternatively YhjX may be involved with pyruvate transport. YhjX may function with frc and oxc to catabolize oxalate. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). The yhjX promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).
